The problem with the proposition in the article is that it is only presenting one side of the argument without providing an in-depth analysis of the issue. The article fails to provide any evidence or data to support the conclusion that adding the "Think step-by-step" prompt can improve the reasoning ability of LLM, and does not address any potential drawbacks or drawbacks of the proposal.

The problem to be solved is the need to improve the output of the LLM so that manual post-processing is not required.
2023-06-22 12:19:24,321 - INFO - Hypothesis: 
One solution to this problem might involve making use of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to automate the post-processing tasks, such as natural language processing and text analytics. This could enable the LLM to make faster decisions and enable more accurate results. Additionally, implementing machine learning algorithms could help the system identify patterns and anomalies in the data to improve the output and reduce the need for manual post-processing. Finally, implementing data visualisation tools, such as dashboards and interactive graphs, could help put the data into context and make the results easier to interpret and understand.
2023-06-22 12:21:01,409 - INFO - Problem: 
The problem to be solved is properly formatting the output of the LLM.
2023-06-22 12:21:05,933 - INFO - Hypothesis: 
Solution:
1. Identify the format needed for the output of the LLM
2. Set up an automated process or template for formatting the output
3. Use a software tool or script to ensure the output is formatted correctly every time
