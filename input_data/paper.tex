\section{Discussion}
We find that adding "Think step-by-step" in the prompt increases the reasoning ability of large language models (LLM).
However, due to the output of the language models (LLM) not being properly formatted, manual post-processing was required. 
For example, we used mathmatics tasks where the output is like "The answer is 1". However, to evaluate the answer, we must extract only "1" from the output.
This is what we mean by "manual post-processing". This is the problem that needs to be addressed in the future.
