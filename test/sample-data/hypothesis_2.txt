Implementing a more focused and concise prompt strategy in the Large Language Model (LLM) will reduce the occurrence of extraneous sentences in the output, thereby increasing the direct relevance of the output to the input instructions. This can be tested by comparing the output of the LLM with the new prompt strategy to the output with the previous strategy, and quantifying the amount of extraneous information in each.
