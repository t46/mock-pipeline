Hypothesis 2: We could modify the prompt to instruct the model to give a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is the capital of France?", we could ask "Give a direct answer: What is the capital of France?". This might encourage the model to respond with a more direct answer like "Paris" instead of providing a lengthy explanation or context about France and its capital.
