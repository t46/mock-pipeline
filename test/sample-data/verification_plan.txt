Verification plan:  Verification Plan:

1. Preparation:
   1.1. Ensure that the OpenAIChat (OAC) is set up and ready for use.
   1.2. Choose a model 'gpt-4' for the experiment.
   1.3. Set the temperature parameter (T) to 0.0.
   1.4. Prepare a set of diverse input prompts (P) for testing. The prompts should be varied enough to cover different types of questions and statements.

2. Experiment Execution:
   2.1. For each input prompt (P) in the prepared set, perform the following steps:
       2.1.1. Feed the prompt (P) to the OAC implemented with 'gpt-4' and T = 0.0.
       2.1.2. Record the response (R) generated by the model.
       2.1.3. Repeat steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 for a significant number of times (for instance, 100 times) for each prompt.
       2.1.4. Store all the responses for each prompt in a structured format for analysis.

3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. For each input prompt (P), compare all the responses (R) generated in the experiment.
   3.2. Check if all the responses for a given prompt are identical. If they are, it indicates that the model is generating deterministic and consistent responses.
   3.3. Calculate the percentage of prompts for which the responses were consistent. This will give an overall measure of the consistency of the model.

4. Conclusion:
   4.1. If the percentage of prompts with consistent responses is significantly high (for instance, above 95%), then the hypothesis can be considered as verified.
   4.2. If the percentage is low, then the hypothesis is not verified, and further investigation would be needed to understand the reasons for the inconsistency.

5. Documentation:
   5.1. Document the entire process, including the preparation, execution, data analysis, and conclusion.
   5.2. Include the raw data, calculations, and any scripts or code used in the experiment.
   5.3. Write a final report summarizing the verification process and the results.
