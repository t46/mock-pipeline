Verification plan:  Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Collect a diverse set of questions that can be used as prompts. These questions should cover a wide range of topics and should be such that they have a direct answer. For example, "What is the capital of France?", "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?", "What is the square root of 16?", etc.
   1.2. For each question, create a modified version of the prompt by adding "Give a direct answer:" at the beginning. For example, "Give a direct answer: What is the capital of France?".
2. Model Testing:
   2.1. Input each original prompt (P1) into the LLM and record the response (R1).
   2.2. Input each modified prompt (P2) into the LLM and record the response (R2).
3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. For each pair of responses (R1 and R2), calculate the length of the response in terms of the number of words.
   3.2. Compare the length of R1 and R2. If the length of R2 is less than or equal to the length of R1, it indicates that the modified prompt may have led to a more concise response.
   3.3. Additionally, evaluate the directness of the response. This can be done by checking if the first sentence of the response contains the direct answer to the question. For example, if the question is "What is the capital of France?", the first sentence of the response should contain "Paris". Count the number of instances where this is true for R2 and compare it with the number of instances where this is true for R1.
4. Statistical Analysis:
   4.1. Perform a statistical test (such as a paired t-test) to determine if the differences in response length and directness between R1 and R2 are statistically significant.
5. Conclusion:
   5.1. If the statistical test shows a significant difference with the modified prompts leading to shorter and more direct responses, then the hypothesis can be considered verified.
   5.2. If there is no significant difference, or if the original prompts lead to shorter and more direct responses, then the hypothesis is not verified.

This verification plan is feasible as it only requires the use of the existing LLM and does not require the creation of any new tools or resources. It is also detailed and concrete, providing a step-by-step procedure that can be followed to test the hypothesis.
