The research problem identified in the text is the need for manual post-processing of the output generated by large language models (LLM) when "Think step-by-step" is added in the prompt. More specifically, this issue emerges when evaluating mathematical tasks, as the output, such as "The answer is 1", must be manually processed to extract the numeric answer "1". The researchers highlight this as an area that needs to be addressed in future studies.
