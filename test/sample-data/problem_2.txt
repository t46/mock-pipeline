Background:
We use a Large Language Model (LLM), in particular, GPT-4, which takes any text as input and outputs some text. We input instructions to the LLM in text, which is called prompt, to the LLM, and the LLM outputs text in response to those instructions.

Problem:
The problem is that the large language model may also output sentences that are not directly related to the instructions. 
For example, suppose you enter the sentence "What is 1 + 1?" into the LLM. 
At this point, the LLM will often respond, "The answer to that question is 2". In this answer statement, what we really want is the "2" part. The sentence "The answer to that question is" is an extra sentence, and we want the LLM to output only the part that directly answers the question, not the extra sentence.

The reason this is problematic is that the we must do some post-processing to evaluate the output sentences. For example, let's say you want to evaluate LLM's performance on a dataset of math problems. Suppose a sample is a question "What is 1 + 1?" paired with the correct answer "2". To evaluate the LLM's performance on this, we must examine whether the LLM's answer matches the correct answer. At this point, if the LLM outputs an extra sentence other than "2," even if the answer is actually correct, it may be judged incorrect because of the apparent mismatch.
It is difficult to deal with this in a predefined post-processing method, since it is not known in advance what kind of text will be output that are not directly related to the question.

TO sum up, the problems are following:
- large language model output sentences that are not directly related to the instructions. 
- predefined post-processing method has been problem/answer-specific and not general.
