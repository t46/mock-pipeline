1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Collect a large dataset of prompts and their corresponding correct responses. This dataset will be used to evaluate the performance of the LLM with the old and new prompt strategies.
   1.2. Divide the dataset into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to fine-tune the LLM with the new prompt strategy, and the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the LLM.

2. Baseline Evaluation:
   2.1. Use the old prompt strategy to generate responses to the prompts in the test set.
   2.2. For each generated response, calculate the proportion of extraneous sentences (E_old) and the relevance score (R_old). This can be done manually or by developing an automated metric. For example, the proportion of extraneous sentences can be calculated as the number of extraneous sentences divided by the total number of sentences in the response, and the relevance score can be calculated using cosine similarity between the input instructions and the output.

3. Implementation of the New Prompt Strategy:
   3.1. Fine-tune the LLM on the training set using the new prompt strategy.
   3.2. Use the fine-tuned LLM to generate responses to the prompts in the test set.

4. Evaluation of the New Prompt Strategy:
   4.1. For each generated response, calculate the proportion of extraneous sentences (E_new) and the relevance score (R_new) in the same way as in step 2.2.

5. Comparison and Hypothesis Testing:
   5.1. Compare E_old and E_new. If E_new <= 0.8 * E_old, then the new prompt strategy has successfully reduced the proportion of extraneous sentences.
   5.2. Compare R_old and R_new. If R_new >= 1.15 * R_old, then the new prompt strategy has successfully increased the relevance score.
   5.3. If both conditions in steps 5.1 and 5.2 are met, then the hypothesis is confirmed. If not, the hypothesis is rejected.

6. Reporting Results:
   6.1. Document the results of the hypothesis testing, including the calculated values of E_old, E_new, R_old, and R_new, and whether the hypothesis was confirmed or rejected.
   6.2. If the hypothesis was confirmed, provide recommendations for implementing the new prompt strategy in the LLM. If the hypothesis was rejected, provide insights into why the new prompt strategy did not work as expected and suggest potential modifications for future testing.
