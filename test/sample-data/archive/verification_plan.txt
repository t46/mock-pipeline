1. Selecting the Language Model:
    
    1.1 Identify the large language model (LLM) that will be used for this experiment. This could be a model such as GPT-3, BERT, etc. The selection will depend on the specific language model in use for your application.
    
2. Data Preparation:
    
    2.1 Choose a set of mathematical tasks that will be given to the LLM. Ensure that these tasks are complex enough that the LLM's output would typically need to be post-processed.
    
    2.2 Divide the tasks into two groups - one for the control condition (without the prompt strategy), and one for the experimental condition (with the prompt strategy). Ensure that the tasks are evenly matched in terms of difficulty and complexity.
    
3. Running the Control Condition:
    
    3.1 Use the LLM to generate answers to the mathematical tasks from the control group.
    
    3.2 The control group will not be given any specific prompt formatting instruction.
    
    3.3 Record the raw output of the LLM.
    
    3.4 Manually post-process the output of the LLM to isolate the answer as required by the evaluation process. Record the time taken for this post-processing. This will be T1.
    
4. Implementing the Prompt Strategy:
    
    4.1 Develop a strategy for structured prompting that instructs the LLM to output answers in a specific format. For example, this could be a specific instruction such as "Please provide the answer as a numerical figure only."
    
5. Running the Experimental Condition:
    
    5.1 Use the LLM to generate answers to the mathematical tasks from the experimental group.
    
    5.2 The experimental group will be given the structured prompt strategy developed in step 4.
    
    5.3 Record the raw output of the LLM.
    
    5.4 Manually post-process the output of the LLM to isolate the answer as required by the evaluation process. Record the time taken for this post-processing. This will be T2.
    
6. Analysing the Results:
    
    6.1 Calculate the percentage reduction in post-processing time using the formula ((T1 - T2)/T1) * 100.
    
    6.2 If the percentage reduction is greater than or equal to 20%, then the hypothesis is confirmed. If it is less than 20%, then the hypothesis is not confirmed.
    
7. Documenting the Results:
    
    7.1 Write a detailed report on the procedure, the calculations, and the results obtained.
    
    7.2 Draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the structured prompt strategy.
    
8. Repeating the Experiment:
    
    8.1 In order to make sure the results obtained are reliable, this experiment should be repeated multiple times with different sets of mathematical tasks.
