Hypothesis: If we engineer a new prompt technique that instructs the large language model to provide the solution in a specific format (e.g., "Output just the numeric answer"), we will eliminate the need for manual post-processing in extracting the numeric answer from the statements generated by the model when "Think step-by-step" is added in the prompt. This methodology would, therefore, increase the efficiency and accuracy of mathematical problem-solving tasks by large language models.
