Hypothesis: Implementing a prompt engineering strategy that explicitly instructs the language model to provide answers in a predefined format (for instance, specifying that the answer should be a numerical figure alone) will significantly reduce the need for manual post-processing and expedite the evaluation process. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the outputs of tasks before and after the application of the prompt engineering strategy, and observing if the amount of postprocessing required decreases.
