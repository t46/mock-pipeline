Verification Plan:

1. Data Preparation:
   1.1. Prepare a dataset of prompts that the LLM can respond to. The dataset should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics to ensure the results are generalizable.
   1.2. Split the dataset into two equal parts, ensuring that both parts are representative of the whole dataset.

2. Model Training:
   2.1. Train two identical LLMs (GPT-4) using the same hyperparameters and training conditions to ensure a fair comparison.
   2.2. For the first LLM (Traditional Model), use the first half of the dataset with traditional prompt structure.
   2.3. For the second LLM (Specific Model), use the second half of the dataset but modify the prompts to the more specific structure, such as "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

3. Model Testing:
   3.1. Prepare a testing dataset that is separate from the training dataset. This dataset should also be diverse and representative.
   3.2. Use the testing dataset to generate responses from both models. For the Specific Model, modify the prompts to the more specific structure.

4. Data Collection:
   4.1. Record the responses from both models.
   4.2. Count the number of words in each response. This will be our measure of conciseness.

5. Data Analysis:
   5.1. Calculate the average number of words in the responses from the Traditional Model (T) and the Specific Model (S).
   5.2. Perform a t-test to compare the means of T and S. This will tell us if the difference in conciseness is statistically significant.
   5.3. If the p-value from the t-test is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis (H0: S >= T) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1: S < T). This would mean that the Specific Model generates more concise responses.
   5.4. If the p-value from the t-test is greater than or equal to 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. This would mean that the Specific Model does not generate more concise responses.

6. Reporting:
   6.1. Document the process and results of the experiment.
   6.2. Include the calculated averages, t-test results, and any other relevant statistics.
   6.3. Discuss the implications of the results and any potential improvements that could be made to the experiment.
   6.4. If the hypothesis is confirmed, propose potential applications and further research. If the hypothesis is not confirmed, propose potential reasons and alternative hypotheses.
