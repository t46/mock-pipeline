```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# 1. Data Preparation
# Assuming we have a dataset 'prompts.csv' with a column 'prompt'
data = pd.read_csv('prompts.csv')
train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# 2. Model Training
# Assuming we have a function 'train_model' that trains a model given a dataset and a prompt structure
# And a function 'modify_prompt' that modifies a prompt to a more specific structure
train_model(train['prompt'], 'traditional')
train_model(train['prompt'].apply(modify_prompt), 'specific')

# 3. Model Testing
# Assuming we have a function 'test_model' that generates responses given a dataset and a model type
responses_traditional = test_model(test['prompt'], 'traditional')
responses_specific = test_model(test['prompt'].apply(modify_prompt), 'specific')

# 4. Data Collection
# Assuming we have a function 'count_words' that counts the number of words in a response
word_counts_traditional = responses_traditional.apply(count_words)
word_counts_specific = responses_specific.apply(count_words)

# 5. Data Analysis
average_traditional = np.mean(word_counts_traditional)
average_specific = np.mean(word_counts_specific)

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(word_counts_traditional, word_counts_specific)

# 6. Reporting
print(f'Average word count for traditional model: {average_traditional}')
print(f'Average word count for specific model: {average_specific}')
print(f'T-test results: t = {t_stat}, p = {p_value}')

if p_value < 0.05:
    print('The specific model generates more concise responses.')
else:
    print('The specific model does not generate more concise responses.')

This code assumes the existence of several functions (`train_model`, `modify_prompt`, `test_model`, `count_words`) that are not defined in the provided verification plan. These functions would need to be implemented for the code to run.
