Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: We could train the LLM with a more specific prompt structure. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Training the Language Learning Model (LLM) with a more specific prompt structure, such as "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" instead of "What is 1 + 1?", will result in the generation of more concise responses.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative study. We will train two identical LLMs, one with the traditional prompt structure and the other with the more specific prompt structure. We will then compare the conciseness of the responses generated by both models.

Mathematically, we can represent the conciseness of a response as the number of words in the response. If we denote the average number of words in the responses generated by the traditional model as T and the average number of words in the responses generated by the specific model as S, our hypothesis can be represented as:

H0: S >= T (Null Hypothesis: The specific model does not generate more concise responses)
H1: S < T (Alternative Hypothesis: The specific model generates more concise responses)

We can then use a t-test to compare the means of the two samples and determine whether the difference is statistically significant.
