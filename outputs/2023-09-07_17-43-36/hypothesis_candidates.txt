Hypothesis 1: 
We could train the LLM with a more specific prompt structure. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could develop a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response that directly answer the question.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could fine-tune the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the questions. This could help the model learn to generate more direct responses.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could modify the LLM's architecture or loss function to penalize verbose responses. This could encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM, providing rewards for concise and direct responses and penalties for verbose or indirect responses.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a two-step process where the LLM first generates a response, and then a second model simplifies or extracts the key information from that response.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a question-answering model instead of a general-purpose LLM. These models are specifically designed to provide direct answers to questions.

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a combination of the above strategies, such as fine-tuning the LLM on a specific dataset and then using a post-processing method to extract the most relevant information from the output.
