Here is the regenerated Python code with the requested modifications:

```python

from scipy import stats
from openai import GPT3

# 1. Data Collection
questions = ["What is 1 + 1?", "What is the capital of France?", "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?", "What is the chemical symbol for water?"]
modified_questions = ["Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?", "Provide a one-word answer: What is the capital of France?", "Provide a one-word answer: Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?", "Provide a one-word answer: What is the chemical symbol for water?"]

# 2. Experiment Setup
random.shuffle(questions)
random.shuffle(modified_questions)

# 3. Execution
gpt3 = GPT3()

modified_responses = [gpt3.complete(q) for q in modified_questions]

# 4. Data Analysis
def calculate_metrics(responses):
    lengths = [len(nltk.word_tokenize(r)) for r in responses]
    complexities = [len(nltk.sent_tokenize(r)) for r in responses]
    return sum(lengths) / len(lengths), sum(complexities) / len(complexities)

L1, C1 = calculate_metrics(original_responses)
L2, C2 = calculate_metrics(modified_responses)

# 5. Hypothesis Testing
length_p_value = stats.ttest_ind([len(nltk.word_tokenize(r)) for r in original_responses], [len(nltk.word_tokenize(r)) for r in modified_responses]).pvalue
complexity_p_value = stats.ttest_ind([len(nltk.sent_tokenize(r)) for r in original_responses], [len(nltk.sent_tokenize(r)) for r in modified_responses]).pvalue

# 6. Conclusion

    conclusion = "The modification of the prompting strategy results in more concise responses from the LLM."
else:
    conclusion = "The modification of the prompting strategy does not significantly affect the conciseness of the LLM's responses."
