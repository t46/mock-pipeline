Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Prepare a set of questions that can be answered in one word. These questions should cover a variety of topics to ensure the results are not biased towards a specific subject.
   1.2. For each question, create two versions of the prompt: the original version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the modified version (e.g., "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?").

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. Divide the questions into two groups: one for the original prompts and one for the modified prompts.
   2.2. Ensure that the two groups are balanced, i.e., they contain an equal number of questions from each topic.

3. Execution:
   3.1. Input the original prompts into the LLM and record the responses.
   3.2. Input the modified prompts into the LLM and record the responses.

4. Data Analysis:
   4.1. For each response, calculate the length (L) as the number of words in the response.
   4.2. For each response, calculate the complexity (C) as the number of clauses or sentences in the response.
   4.3. Calculate the average length (L1 for original prompts, L2 for modified prompts) and average complexity (C1 for original prompts, C2 for modified prompts) for each group of responses.

5. Hypothesis Testing:
   5.1. Use a statistical test (e.g., t-test) to compare the average lengths (L1 and L2) and complexities (C1 and C2) of the responses to the original and modified prompts.
   5.2. If the test shows a significant difference (p < 0.05), reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1). This would indicate that the modified prompts result in shorter and less complex responses.
   5.3. If the test does not show a significant difference (p >= 0.05), do not reject the null hypothesis. This would indicate that the modified prompts do not significantly affect the length or complexity of the responses.

6. Conclusion:
   6.1. If the alternative hypothesis is accepted, conclude that the modification of the prompting strategy results in more concise responses from the LLM.
   6.2. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, conclude that the modification of the prompting strategy does not significantly affect the conciseness of the LLM's responses.

7. Reporting:
   7.1. Document the entire process, including the data collection, experiment setup, execution, data analysis, and conclusion.
   7.2. Report the results in a clear and concise manner, including the statistical test results and the final conclusion.
