Original Hypothesis:
Refining the Prompting Strategy - We could refine the way we prompt the LLM. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

Refined Hypothesis:
The modification of the prompting strategy in the Language Learning Model (LLM) will result in more concise responses. Specifically, by changing the prompt from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?", the LLM will generate a one-word response instead of a longer, more complex one.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative analysis method. We will compare the length and complexity of responses generated by the LLM when given the two different prompts. The length of the response can be measured by the number of words in the response, and the complexity can be measured by the number of clauses or sentences.

Mathematically, if L1 and L2 represent the length of responses to the original and modified prompts respectively, and C1 and C2 represent the complexity of responses to the original and modified prompts respectively, our hypothesis can be expressed as:

H0: L1 = L2 and C1 = C2 (No difference in length and complexity of responses)
H1: L1 > L2 and C1 > C2 (Responses to the modified prompt are shorter and less complex)

We will reject the null hypothesis (H0) if the results show a significant difference in the length and complexity of responses to the two prompts.
