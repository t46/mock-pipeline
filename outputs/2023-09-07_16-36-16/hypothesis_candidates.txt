Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that contains only direct answers to the prompts during the training phase. This way, the model might learn to generate more concise and direct responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another LLM to extract the relevant information from the output. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the most relevant part of the response.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By rewarding the model when it provides direct answers and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information, the model might learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning phase could be used to teach the model to generate direct answers, while the unsupervised learning phase could be used to fine-tune the model's ability to generate relevant responses.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that removes common extraneous phrases from the output. This method would require a comprehensive list of such phrases and could be combined with other methods for better results.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a hybrid approach that combines several of the above methods. For example, we could refine the training process, modify the prompt, and use a rule-based post-processing method. This approach might be more effective than using any single method.
