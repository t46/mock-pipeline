Here is the Python code to execute the verification plan:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
from openai import GPT3

# Initialize the GPT-3 model
gpt3 = GPT3(api_key="your_api_key")

# Prepare the dataset
questions = ["your list of questions"]
half = len(questions) // 2
questions1 = questions[:half]
questions2 = ["Provide a one-word answer: " + q for q in questions[half:]]

# Traditional questioning
responses1 = [gpt3.ask(q) for q in questions1]

# Modified questioning
responses2 = [gpt3.ask(q) for q in questions2]

# Analysis of responses
avg_len1 = np.mean([len(r) for r in responses1])
avg_len2 = np.mean([len(r) for r in responses2])

print(f"Average length of responses in R1: {avg_len1}")
print(f"Average length of responses in R2: {avg_len2}")

# Statistical analysis
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind([len(r) for r in responses1], [len(r) for r in responses2])
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat}, p-value: {p_val}")

# Documentation
with open("experiment_results.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Questions:\n")
    f.write("\n".join(questions))
    f.write("\n\nResponses in R1:\n")
    f.write("\n".join(responses1))
    f.write("\n\nResponses in R2:\n")
    f.write("\n".join(responses2))
    f.write(f"\n\nAverage length of responses in R1: {avg_len1}")
    f.write(f"\nAverage length of responses in R2: {avg_len2}")
    f.write(f"\nt-statistic: {t_stat}, p-value: {p_val}")

# Review and repeat
# This part is subjective and depends on the results of the experiment and the judgement of the experimenter
```

Please replace `"your list of questions"` with your actual list of questions and `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key. Note that the `GPT3` class and its `ask` method are placeholders for whatever library and method you're using to interact with the GPT-3 model. You'll need to replace them with the actual code that sends a question to the model and gets a response.
