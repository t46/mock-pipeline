Verification Plan:

1. Preparation of Dataset:
    1.1. Prepare a dataset of questions that can be answered in a single word or a short phrase. The dataset should be large enough to provide statistically significant results. For example, a dataset of 1000 questions could be used.
    1.2. Divide the dataset into two equal halves. The first half will be used for traditional questioning, and the second half will be used for modified questioning.

2. Traditional Questioning:
    2.1. Feed the first half of the questions to the LLM in their original form.
    2.2. Record the responses from the LLM in a list, R1.

3. Modified Questioning:
    3.1. Modify the second half of the questions by adding the instruction "Provide a one-word answer:" at the beginning of each question.
    3.2. Feed these modified questions to the LLM.
    3.3. Record the responses from the LLM in a separate list, R2.

4. Analysis of Responses:
    4.1. Calculate the average length of the responses in R1. This can be done by summing the lengths of all responses and dividing by the number of responses.
    4.2. Calculate the average length of the responses in R2 in the same way.
    4.3. Compare the two average lengths. If the average length of the responses in R2 is less than the average length of the responses in R1, then the hypothesis is confirmed.

5. Statistical Analysis:
    5.1. To further validate the results, perform a statistical test, such as a t-test, to determine if the difference in average lengths is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the difference is statistically significant.

6. Documentation:
    6.1. Document the entire process, including the preparation of the dataset, the exact questions used, the responses from the LLM, and the results of the analysis.
    6.2. If the hypothesis is confirmed, provide a detailed explanation of the results and their implications. If the hypothesis is not confirmed, provide possible reasons and suggest improvements for future testing.

7. Review and Repeat:
    7.1. Review the results and the testing process to identify any potential issues or improvements.
    7.2. If necessary, repeat the testing process with the improvements implemented.
