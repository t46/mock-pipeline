Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the prompt to instruct the Language Learning Model (LLM) to provide a direct answer will result in more concise responses. For instance, changing the question from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" will yield a one-word response from the LLM.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative analysis method. We will use a set of questions, half of which will be asked in the traditional manner and the other half will be asked with the "Provide a one-word answer" instruction. The responses from the LLM will then be analyzed for their length and conciseness. 

Mathematically, if Q represents the set of questions and R represents the set of responses, we can define a function f: Q -> R that maps each question to its response. The hypothesis can then be tested by comparing the lengths of the responses in R for the two different types of questions in Q. 

In pseudo code, the testing process could look like this:

```
for question in Q:
    response = LLM.ask(question)
    R.append(response)

average_length_traditional = average_length(R[0:len(Q)/2])
average_length_modified = average_length(R[len(Q)/2:])

if average_length_modified < average_length_traditional:
    print("Hypothesis confirmed")
else:
    print("Hypothesis not confirmed")
```

This pseudo code assumes that the first half of the questions in Q are asked in the traditional manner and the second half are asked with the "Provide a one-word answer" instruction. The function `average_length` calculates the average length of the responses in a given subset of R.
