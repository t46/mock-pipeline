Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that only contains direct answers to the prompts, thus teaching the model to respond in a similar manner.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another LLM to extract the relevant information from the output. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the direct answer from a larger text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt structure to guide the LLM towards providing a more direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By rewarding the model when it provides direct answers and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information, the model might learn to provide more direct responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning could be used to teach the model to provide direct answers, while the unsupervised learning could be used to help the model generalize this ability to new prompts.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that identifies and removes common extraneous phrases from the LLM's output. This would require a comprehensive list of such phrases, which could be compiled through manual review of the model's output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a hybrid approach that combines several of the above methods. For example, we could refine the training process, modify the prompt structure, and use a rule-based post-processing method all at the same time. This could potentially address the issue from multiple angles and increase the likelihood of success.
