Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompt structure to guide the LLM towards providing a more direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: The structure of the prompt can influence the directness of the response from the Language Learning Model (LLM). Specifically, by modifying the prompt to include a directive for a one-word answer, the LLM will provide a more direct response. This can be tested by comparing the responses of the LLM to the prompts "What is 1 + 1?" and "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Mathematical Representation:
Let P1 represent the prompt "What is 1 + 1?" and P2 represent the prompt "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". Let R1 and R2 represent the responses to P1 and P2 respectively. The hypothesis can be represented as: If P1 < P2, then R1 > R2, where '<' represents less directness and '>' represents more directness. 

This hypothesis can be tested using a paired t-test, where the null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the directness of the responses (R1 = R2), and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the response to the modified prompt is more direct (R1 > R2).
