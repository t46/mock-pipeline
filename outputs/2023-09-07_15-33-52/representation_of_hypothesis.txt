Original Hypothesis: 
Refining the prompt given to the LLM might encourage the model to provide a more direct response.

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of the prompt given to the Language Learning Model (LLM) has a direct impact on the directness of the response. In other words, the more specific the prompt, the more direct the response from the LLM.

Mathematical Representation:
Let's denote the specificity of the prompt as 'S' and the directness of the response as 'D'. The hypothesis can be represented as a direct proportionality between 'S' and 'D'. 

S ‚àù D

This means that as 'S' increases, 'D' also increases, suggesting that a more specific prompt will yield a more direct response from the LLM. 

To test this hypothesis, we can use a set of prompts with varying levels of specificity and evaluate the directness of the responses from the LLM. The directness can be measured using a suitable metric, such as the length of the response or the presence of unnecessary information.
