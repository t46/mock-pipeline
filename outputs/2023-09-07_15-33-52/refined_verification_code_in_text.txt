Here is the regenerated Python code with the requested modifications:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the language model
language_model = pipeline('text-generation')

# Define the dataset of prompts
prompts = [
    ("Solve this math problem", 1),
    ("Calculate the sum of 1 and 1", 2),
    ("Provide the numerical answer to the addition of 1 and 1", 3),
]

# Initialize lists to store the directness scores and specificity levels
directness_scores = []
specificity_levels = []

# Run the experiment
for prompt, specificity in prompts:
    # Generate the response from the language model
    response = language_model(prompt)[0]['generated_text']
    
    # Calculate the directness score (here, we use the length of the response as a simple metric)
    directness_score = len(response)
    
    # Append the scores and levels to the respective lists
    directness_scores.append(directness_score)
    specificity_levels.append(specificity)

# Plot the specificity levels against the directness scores
plt.scatter(specificity_levels, directness_scores)
plt.xlabel('Specificity Level')
plt.ylabel('Directness Score')
plt.title('Specificity vs Directness')
plt.show()

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
correlation_coefficient, _ = pearsonr(specificity_levels, directness_scores)
print(f'Correlation coefficient: {correlation_coefficient}')

# Draw conclusions
if correlation_coefficient > 0.5:
    print("The results show a strong positive correlation, supporting the hypothesis that the specificity of the prompt has a direct impact on the directness of the response.")
elif correlation_coefficient < -0.5:
    print("The results show a strong negative correlation, contradicting the hypothesis that the specificity of the prompt has a direct impact on the directness of the response.")
else:
    print("The results show a weak or no correlation, suggesting that the specificity of the prompt does not significantly affect the directness of the response.")
```
This code will run the experiment as described in the verification plan. It uses the length of the response as a simple metric for directness, but this could be replaced with a more sophisticated metric if desired. The correlation coefficient is used to quantify the relationship between specificity and directness. The conclusions drawn from the results are based on the value of the correlation coefficient.
