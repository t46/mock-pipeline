Verification Plan:

1. Define Specificity and Directness:
   1.1. Specificity: The level of detail and precision in the prompt. A more specific prompt will contain more detailed instructions or questions.
   1.2. Directness: The relevance and conciseness of the LLM's response. A more direct response will contain only the necessary information and will be shorter in length.

2. Create a Dataset:
   2.1. Generate a dataset of prompts with varying levels of specificity. For example, for the math problem "What is 1 + 1?", a less specific prompt might be "Solve this math problem", a more specific prompt might be "Calculate the sum of 1 and 1", and an even more specific prompt might be "Provide the numerical answer to the addition of 1 and 1".
   2.2. Ensure that the dataset is large and diverse enough to cover a wide range of topics and types of prompts.

3. Run the Experiment:
   3.1. Input each prompt from the dataset into the LLM and record the responses.
   3.2. Ensure that the LLM is in the same state (i.e., not updated or modified) throughout the experiment to maintain consistency.

4. Evaluate the Directness of the Responses:
   4.1. Develop a metric to measure the directness of the responses. This could be the length of the response, the presence of unnecessary information, or a combination of both.
   4.2. Use this metric to evaluate the directness of each response from the LLM.

5. Analyze the Results:
   5.1. Plot the specificity of the prompts against the directness of the responses to visualize the relationship between the two.
   5.2. Calculate the correlation coefficient between the specificity of the prompts and the directness of the responses to quantify the strength of the relationship.

6. Draw Conclusions:
   6.1. If the results show a strong positive correlation, this would support the hypothesis that the specificity of the prompt has a direct impact on the directness of the response.
   6.2. If the results show a weak or no correlation, this would suggest that the specificity of the prompt does not significantly affect the directness of the response.

7. Refine the Hypothesis:
   7.1. Based on the results, refine the hypothesis if necessary and repeat the experiment.
   7.2. Consider other factors that might affect the directness of the response, such as the complexity of the prompt or the topic of the prompt.
