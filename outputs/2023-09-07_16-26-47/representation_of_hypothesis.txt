Original Hypothesis: 
The prompt could be modified to instruct the LLM to provide a more direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
The hypothesis suggests that the specificity of the prompt influences the directness of the LLM's response. This can be tested by comparing the responses of the LLM to two different prompts: one general and one specific. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let's denote the response of the LLM to a general prompt as Rg and to a specific prompt as Rs. The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the directness of Rg and Rs. If the directness of Rs is greater than Rg, the hypothesis is supported.

Directness(Rs) > Directness(Rg)

Where Directness is a measure of how direct the response is. This could be quantified by using a scoring system where a higher score indicates a more direct response. 

In terms of a computer program, this could be implemented by creating two prompts: a general one and a specific one. The LLM's responses to these prompts could then be scored for directness, and the scores compared to test the hypothesis.
