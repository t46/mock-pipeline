Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompt structure to encourage more direct responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the structure of a question prompt to explicitly request a specific type of response (e.g., a one-word answer) will result in a higher proportion of direct responses. 

To test this hypothesis, we could conduct an experiment where we randomly assign participants to receive either the original prompt ("What is 1 + 1?") or the modified prompt ("Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?"). We would then compare the proportion of direct responses between the two groups. 

In mathematical terms, let P1 represent the proportion of direct responses in the original prompt group and P2 represent the proportion of direct responses in the modified prompt group. Our hypothesis can then be expressed as: P2 > P1. 

This hypothesis can be tested using a chi-square test of independence or a z-test for proportions, depending on the sample size and the distribution of responses.
