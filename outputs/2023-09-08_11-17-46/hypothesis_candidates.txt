Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the model is rewarded for providing concise, direct answers. This could help the model learn to respond more directly to prompts.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another language model to extract the most relevant information from the output. This model could be trained to identify and extract the key information from a larger text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt structure to encourage more direct responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could implement a reward system within the model's training process that rewards concise and direct answers and penalizes extraneous information. This could help the model learn to provide more direct responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model or algorithm that is specifically designed to provide direct, concise answers. This could involve using a model that is less likely to generate extraneous text.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of the above methods, refining the training data, modifying the prompt structure, implementing a reward system, and using a different model or algorithm, to address the issue from multiple angles.
