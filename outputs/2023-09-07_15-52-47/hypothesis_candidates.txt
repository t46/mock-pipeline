Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the model is rewarded for providing concise, direct answers. This could help the model learn to respond more directly to prompts.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another language model to extract the most relevant information from the output. This model could be trained to identify and extract the key information from a larger text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt to specify the format of the desired answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could implement a reward system during training where the model is rewarded for providing concise answers and penalized for providing extraneous information. This could encourage the model to provide more direct responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a two-step process where the first step is to generate a response and the second step is to summarize the response. The summarization step could help to remove extraneous information.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a technique called "active learning" where the model is initially trained with a small amount of data, then it is used to generate responses which are then labeled by humans. The model is then retrained with the new data. This process is repeated until the model's performance is satisfactory.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a technique called "transfer learning" where the model is first trained on a related task that requires concise answers, then fine-tuned on the actual task. This could help the model learn to provide concise answers.
