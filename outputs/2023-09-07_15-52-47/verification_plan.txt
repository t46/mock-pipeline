Verification Plan:

1. **Data Collection:**
    1.1. Prepare a list of mathematical questions that can be answered numerically. Ensure that the questions are of varying complexity to test the LLM's ability to respond accurately and concisely.
    1.2. For each question, prepare two versions of the prompt: a general version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and a specific version that requests a numerical answer (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1").

2. **Experiment Setup:**
    2.1. Set up an experiment where the LLM (GPT-4) is asked to answer both versions of each question.
    2.2. Ensure that the order of the questions is randomized to avoid any order effects.

3. **Data Generation:**
    3.1. Input the general version of each question into the LLM and record the output.
    3.2. Input the specific version of each question into the LLM and record the output.
    3.3. For each output, categorize it as either a numerical response or a non-numerical response.

4. **Data Analysis:**
    4.1. Calculate the proportion of numerical responses for the general version of the questions (R1/N).
    4.2. Calculate the proportion of numerical responses for the specific version of the questions (R2/N).

5. **Statistical Testing:**
    5.1. Formulate the null hypothesis (H0): The proportion of numerical responses is the same for both versions of the questions (R1/N = R2/N).
    5.2. Formulate the alternative hypothesis (H1): The proportion of numerical responses is greater for the specific version of the questions (R1/N < R2/N).
    5.3. Conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine whether the difference in proportions is statistically significant.
    5.4. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. This would support the original hypothesis that modifying the format of a question prompt can influence the type of response received.

6. **Report Findings:**
    6.1. Document the findings of the experiment, including the statistical test results and any observed trends or patterns in the LLM's responses.
    6.2. If the original hypothesis is supported, provide recommendations for how to modify question prompts to elicit numerical responses from the LLM.
    6.3. If the original hypothesis is not supported, suggest potential reasons why and propose new hypotheses for future testing.
