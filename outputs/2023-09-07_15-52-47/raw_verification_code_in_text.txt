# Initialize GPT-4
gpt4 = GPT4()

# 1. Data Collection
questions = [
    ("What is 1 + 1?", "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"),
    ("What is the square root of 16?", "Provide the numerical answer to the square root of 16"),

# 5. Statistical Testing
# Null Hypothesis (H0): R1/N = R2/N
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): R1/N < R2/N

# Create a contingency table

else:
    print("The proportion of numerical responses is not significantly different between the two versions of the questions.")

# 6. Report Findings
# This will be done outside of the code, based on the results of the experiment and statistical test.
