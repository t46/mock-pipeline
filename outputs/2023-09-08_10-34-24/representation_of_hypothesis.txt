Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer will result in more precise responses. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", if we ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", the likelihood of receiving a direct numerical answer increases.

To test this hypothesis, we can conduct an experiment where we ask a group of participants a set of questions in two different formats: one in the traditional format (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the other in the modified format (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"). We can then compare the precision of the responses between the two formats.

Mathematically, we can represent this hypothesis as follows:

Let's denote the precision of responses to the traditional format as P(T) and the precision of responses to the modified format as P(M). Our hypothesis can then be represented as P(M) > P(T), where P is a function measuring the precision of responses.
