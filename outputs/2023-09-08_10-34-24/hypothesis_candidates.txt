Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the model is expected to respond with a direct answer. This could help the model learn to provide more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the model's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response and discarding the rest.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model to provide more concise responses. This would involve rewarding the model when it provides a direct answer and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to providing concise responses. For example, a transformer-based model might be more effective at this task than a recurrent neural network.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a multi-step process where the model first generates a response and then a second model refines that response to make it more concise.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task, such as question answering, which might be more adept at providing direct answers.
