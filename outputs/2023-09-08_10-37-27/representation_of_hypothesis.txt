Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompts to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the prompts to be more specific about the type of response required will increase the accuracy of responses. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", if we ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", it will lead to more accurate numerical responses.

This hypothesis can be tested by conducting an experiment where a group of participants are given both types of prompts and their responses are recorded. The accuracy of the responses can then be compared between the two types of prompts. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let A be the accuracy of responses to the original prompts and B be the accuracy of responses to the modified prompts. 

The hypothesis can then be expressed as: B > A. 

This means that the accuracy of responses to the modified prompts (B) is greater than the accuracy of responses to the original prompts (A).
