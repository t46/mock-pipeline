Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that contains only direct answers to the questions, thus teaching the model to respond in a similar manner.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the most relevant information from the output. This could involve using Named Entity Recognition (NER) or other information extraction techniques to identify and extract the answer from the output.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompts to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By providing rewards for direct answers and penalties for extraneous information, the model could learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a two-step process where the first model generates the response and the second model, trained specifically for this purpose, trims the response down to the most relevant part.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing system that removes common extraneous phrases like "The answer to that question is". This would require a comprehensive list of such phrases and could be combined with other methods for better results.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning could focus on generating accurate responses, while the unsupervised learning could focus on removing extraneous information.
