1. Improve Training Data: The LLM could be trained on a dataset where the answers are given in the desired format. This would help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the instructions.

2. Post-Processing Algorithms: Develop more sophisticated post-processing algorithms that can extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the key information.

3. Modify the Prompt: The instructions given to the LLM could be modified to specify the desired format of the response. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

4. Fine-Tuning the Model: The LLM could be fine-tuned on a specific task to make it more likely to produce the desired output. For example, if the task is to answer math problems, the model could be fine-tuned on a dataset of math problems and their answers.

5. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where the LLM learns from its mistakes. If the model produces an undesired output, this could be fed back into the model as a negative example, helping it to learn the correct output format over time.

6. Use of Reinforcement Learning: Implement a reinforcement learning approach where the model is rewarded for producing outputs in the desired format and penalized for producing extraneous text.

7. Multi-Stage Model: Implement a multi-stage model where the first stage generates a response and the second stage refines the response to remove any extraneous text.

8. Use of Attention Mechanism: Implement an attention mechanism in the model that allows it to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating a response. This could help the model to produce more directly related outputs.
