Original Hypothesis:
The hypothesis suggests that refining prompts to be more specific, such as changing "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", might encourage the Language Learning Model (LLM) to respond with just the number.

Refined Hypothesis:
The hypothesis can be refined and made more specific by stating it as follows: "The specificity of a prompt directly influences the LLM's response. If a prompt is more specific, such as asking for a 'numerical answer' instead of a general 'what is', the LLM is more likely to respond with a precise numerical answer."

This hypothesis can be tested by conducting an experiment where the LLM is given two sets of prompts - one set with general prompts (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and another set with specific prompts (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"). The responses of the LLM to these two sets of prompts can then be compared to determine if the specificity of the prompt influences the precision of the LLM's response.

In mathematical terms, this hypothesis can be represented as follows:

Let G represent the set of general prompts and S represent the set of specific prompts. Let Rg represent the set of responses to the general prompts and Rs represent the set of responses to the specific prompts. The hypothesis can then be represented as:

If G -> Rg and S -> Rs, then the specificity of S will result in Rs being more precise than Rg. 

This can be tested by comparing the precision of Rs and Rg. If Rs is more precise than Rg, then the hypothesis is supported. If not, the hypothesis is not supported.
