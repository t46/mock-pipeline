Experiment Report:

Hypothesis: More specific prompts result in more precise responses from the LLM.

Experiment Design: We created two datasets of prompts - one general and one specific. We input each prompt into the LLM and recorded the responses. We then determined whether each response was precise according to our definition (a numerical answer).

Results: The proportion of precise responses for general prompts was {proportion_general}. The proportion of precise responses for specific prompts was {proportion_specific}.

Conclusions: {'More specific prompts result in more precise responses.' if proportion_specific > proportion_general else 'The specificity of the prompt does not significantly influence the precision of the response.'}

Future Research: We suggest further research to explore the reasons for these results. For example, it may be that the LLM is more likely to provide a precise response when the prompt is phrased in a certain way.
