Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM with a dataset that includes both the question and the desired format of the answer. This could help the model learn to respond in the desired format.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could develop a post-processing algorithm that extracts the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the key information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it provides the answer in the desired format and penalize it when it includes extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to this task. For example, a sequence-to-sequence model might be more appropriate for generating specific types of responses.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a two-step process where the LLM first generates a response, and then a second model refines that response to fit the desired format.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task. This could help the model to better understand the desired format of the response.

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a model that allows for more control over the output, such as a controlled language generation model. This could allow us to specify the format of the response in more detail.
