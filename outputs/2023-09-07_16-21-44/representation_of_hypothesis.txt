Original Hypothesis: 
We could refine the prompt to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number.

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of a question prompt influences the format of the AI model's response. In particular, asking for a "numerical answer" to a mathematical question, such as "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", will increase the likelihood of the model responding with a number only, compared to a less specific prompt like "What is 1 + 1?".

Mathematical Representation:
Let's denote the event of receiving a numerical response as N and the event of asking a specific question as S. We hypothesize that the probability of receiving a numerical response given a specific question, P(N|S), is greater than the probability of receiving a numerical response given a non-specific question, P(N|~S). In mathematical terms:

P(N|S) > P(N|~S)

This hypothesis can be tested by running an experiment where we ask the AI model a set of specific and non-specific questions and record the format of the responses.
