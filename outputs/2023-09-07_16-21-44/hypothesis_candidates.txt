Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompt to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the model with a dataset that includes both the question and the desired format of the answer. This could help the model learn to respond in the desired format.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could use a secondary model to post-process the output of the LLM. This model could be trained to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could modify the LLM's architecture to include an attention mechanism that focuses on the relevant parts of the input when generating the output. This could help the model to generate more relevant responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model, providing rewards when the model generates the desired output and penalties when it generates extraneous text.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based system to post-process the output of the LLM. This system could use a set of predefined rules to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a combination of the above methods, refining the prompt, training the model with a specific dataset, using a secondary model or rule-based system for post-processing, and modifying the LLM's architecture or training method.
