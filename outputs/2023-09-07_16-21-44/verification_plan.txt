Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Identify a set of mathematical questions that can be asked in both specific and non-specific ways. For example, "What is 1 + 1?" (non-specific) and "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" (specific).
   1.2. Ensure that the set of questions is large enough to provide statistically significant results. A sample size of at least 100 questions is recommended.

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. Divide the set of questions into two groups: one for specific prompts and one for non-specific prompts.
   2.2. Ensure that the same mathematical question is present in both groups but phrased differently according to the group's requirement.

3. Experiment Execution:
   3.1. Input the specific prompts to the LLM and record the responses.
   3.2. Input the non-specific prompts to the LLM and record the responses.

4. Data Analysis:
   4.1. For each response, determine whether it is a numerical response or not. A numerical response is defined as a response that contains only a number and no other text.
   4.2. Calculate the proportion of numerical responses in the specific prompt group. This is an estimate of P(N|S).
   4.3. Calculate the proportion of numerical responses in the non-specific prompt group. This is an estimate of P(N|~S).

5. Hypothesis Testing:
   5.1. Compare P(N|S) and P(N|~S). If P(N|S) > P(N|~S), then the hypothesis is supported.
   5.2. To determine if the difference is statistically significant, perform a chi-square test of independence or a similar statistical test. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the difference is statistically significant.

6. Report Results:
   6.1. Document the experiment process, data analysis, and results.
   6.2. If the hypothesis is supported and the difference is statistically significant, conclude that the specificity of a question prompt influences the format of the AI model's response. If not, conclude that the data does not support the hypothesis.

7. Review and Refine:
   7.1. If the hypothesis is not supported, review the experiment process and data analysis for potential issues.
   7.2. Consider refining the hypothesis or experiment design based on the results and any identified issues. Repeat the experiment if necessary.
