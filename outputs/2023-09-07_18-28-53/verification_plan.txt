Verification Plan:

1. **Data Collection:**
    1.1. Prepare a set of questions that can be answered concisely. These questions should cover a variety of topics to ensure the results are not biased towards a specific subject. For example, the questions could include simple math problems, factual questions about geography, history, etc.
    1.2. Create two versions of each question: a general version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and a specific version that explicitly requests a concise answer (e.g., "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?").
    1.3. The questions should be randomized to avoid any order effects.

2. **Experiment Execution:**
    2.1. Input each question into the LLM (GPT-4) and record the output.
    2.2. Repeat this process for all questions in the dataset.

3. **Data Analysis:**
    3.1. For each response, calculate the length of the response. This could be the number of words, characters, or sentences, depending on the level of granularity desired.
    3.2. Calculate the average length of responses for the general questions (Avg(Rg)) and the specific questions (Avg(Rs)).
    3.3. Compare Avg(Rg) and Avg(Rs) to see if there is a significant difference.

4. **Statistical Testing:**
    4.1. Perform a statistical test to determine if the difference in average response length is statistically significant. A t-test could be used for this purpose.
    4.2. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis (H0: Avg(Rs) = Avg(Rg)) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1: Avg(Rs) < Avg(Rg)). This would support the hypothesis that the specificity of a question prompt directly influences the conciseness of the response.

5. **Result Interpretation:**
    5.1. If the results support the hypothesis, consider implementing more specific prompts in the LLM to encourage more concise responses.
    5.2. If the results do not support the hypothesis, further investigation may be needed to understand why the LLM is not responding as expected.

6. **Report Writing:**
    6.1. Document the entire process, from the preparation of the questions to the execution of the experiment, data analysis, and interpretation of the results.
    6.2. Write a detailed report outlining the methodology, findings, and any potential implications or recommendations based on the results. 

This plan will help verify whether the specificity of a question prompt directly influences the conciseness of the response from a large language model.
