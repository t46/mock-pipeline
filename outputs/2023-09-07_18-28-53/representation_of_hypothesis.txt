Original Hypothesis:
Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer could help. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of a question prompt directly influences the conciseness of the response. For instance, when a question is posed as "What is 1 + 1?", the response may be less concise than when the question is posed as "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

To test this hypothesis, we can conduct an experiment where a group of participants are given a set of questions. Half of the questions are posed in a general manner (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the other half are posed with explicit instructions for conciseness (e.g., "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?"). The responses can then be analyzed for their length and conciseness.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let G be the set of general questions and S be the set of specific questions. Let Rg and Rs be the responses to the general and specific questions respectively. The hypothesis can then be tested by comparing the average length of Rg and Rs. If the average length of Rs is significantly less than Rg, the hypothesis is supported.

H0: Avg(Rs) = Avg(Rg)
H1: Avg(Rs) < Avg(Rg)

Where H0 is the null hypothesis (there is no difference in the conciseness of responses to general and specific questions) and H1 is the alternative hypothesis (responses to specific questions are more concise than responses to general questions).
