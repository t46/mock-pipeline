1. Hypothesis: Fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers could help the model learn to generate more concise responses. This could involve creating a new dataset or modifying an existing one to only include the direct answers.

2. Hypothesis: Implementing a reward system during the training process could help. The model could be rewarded when it provides concise, direct answers and penalized when it includes extraneous information. This would require a reinforcement learning approach.

3. Hypothesis: Developing a post-processing method that uses natural language understanding to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output could be a solution. This could involve using another model trained to identify and extract the answer from a larger text.

4. Hypothesis: Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer could help. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

5. Hypothesis: Using a model architecture that is more suited to generating concise responses could be a solution. For example, a sequence-to-sequence model could be trained to map the input prompt to a concise output.

6. Hypothesis: Implementing a system that ranks multiple outputs from the LLM based on their relevance and conciseness could be a solution. The system could then select the most relevant and concise output.

7. Hypothesis: Using a multi-step process where the LLM first generates a response, and then a second model simplifies or condenses that response, could be a solution. This would involve training a second model on the task of text summarization or simplification.
