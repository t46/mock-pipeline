Here is the Python code to execute the verification plan:

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Prepare the questions
general_questions = ["What is 1 + 1?", "What is the capital of France?", "Who was the first president of the United States?"]
specific_questions = ["Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?", "Provide a one-word answer: What is the capital of France?", "Provide a one-word answer: Who was the first president of the United States?"]

# Randomize the questions
random.shuffle(general_questions)
random.shuffle(specific_questions)

def get_response(question):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(question, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

# Experiment execution
general_responses = [get_response(q) for q in general_questions]
specific_responses = [get_response(q) for q in specific_questions]

# Data analysis
general_lengths = [len(r.split()) for r in general_responses]
specific_lengths = [len(r.split()) for r in specific_responses]

avg_rg = np.mean(general_lengths)
avg_rs = np.mean(specific_lengths)

# Statistical testing
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(general_lengths, specific_lengths)

# Result interpretation
if p_val < 0.05:
    print("The specificity of a question prompt directly influences the conciseness of the response.")
else:
    print("The specificity of a question prompt does not directly influence the conciseness of the response.")
```

Please note that this code assumes you have the transformers library installed and that you have access to the GPT-2 model. If you want to use GPT-4, you would need to replace "gpt2" with the appropriate model name. Also, the code does not include the report writing part, as that would typically be done in a separate document or presentation.
