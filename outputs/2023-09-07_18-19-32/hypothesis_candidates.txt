1. Improve Prompt Design: The way the prompt is designed can influence the output of the LLM. Experiment with different prompt designs to encourage the model to provide more concise answers. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", ask "Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1".

2. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the questions. This could help the model learn to generate more concise responses.

3. Post-Processing with NLP: Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) post-processing system that can extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve named entity recognition, information extraction, or other NLP techniques.

4. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where the model's output is used as an input for the next iteration. This could help the model learn to generate more relevant responses over time.

5. Use of Reinforcement Learning: Implement a reinforcement learning approach where the model is rewarded for providing concise and direct answers and penalized for providing extraneous information.

6. Use of a Wrapper Model: Implement a secondary "wrapper" model that takes the output of the LLM and processes it to extract the relevant information. This model could be trained specifically for this task.

7. Implement a Question-Answering System: Instead of using a general-purpose LLM, use or develop a more specialized question-answering system that is designed to provide direct answers to questions.

8. Use of Attention Mechanisms: Implement attention mechanisms in the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating the output.

9. Multi-Stage Processing: Implement a multi-stage processing system where the first stage generates a response and the second stage refines the response to remove extraneous information.

10. Use of a Supervised Learning Approach: Use a supervised learning approach where the model is trained on a dataset of question-answer pairs, with the answers being the direct responses to the questions.
