Verification Plan:

1. **Data Collection:**
    1.1. Collect a set of questions that can be answered by the LLM. These questions should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics to ensure the results are generalizable.
    1.2. For each question, create two versions of the prompt: one that is open-ended (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and one that is more direct and specific (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1").
    
2. **Experiment Setup:**
    2.1. Divide the questions into two groups: Group A will contain the open-ended prompts, and Group B will contain the direct, specific prompts.
    2.2. Ensure that the groups are balanced, i.e., they contain an equal number of prompts.
    
3. **Running the Experiment:**
    3.1. Input the prompts from Group A into the LLM and record the responses.
    3.2. Repeat the process with the prompts from Group B.
    
4. **Data Analysis:**
    4.1. For each response, calculate its length in terms of the number of words. This will serve as a proxy for the conciseness of the response.
    4.2. Calculate the average length of responses for each group. Let's denote the average length of responses to Group A prompts as A and the average length of responses to Group B prompts as B.
    
5. **Statistical Testing:**
    5.1. Perform a t-test for independent samples to compare the average lengths A and B. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the average lengths of responses between the two groups (A = B), and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average length of responses to the direct, specific prompts is less than that of the open-ended prompts (B < A).
    5.2. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the direct, specific prompts lead to more concise responses. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis.
    
6. **Interpretation and Conclusion:**
    6.1. If the results of the t-test support the alternative hypothesis (B < A), this would suggest that the structure and wording of a prompt can significantly influence the output of the LLM, and that more direct, specific prompts lead to more concise responses.
    6.2. If the results do not support the alternative hypothesis, this would suggest that the structure and wording of a prompt do not significantly influence the conciseness of the LLM's output, or that the effect is not as strong as hypothesized.
    6.3. Regardless of the outcome, the results of this experiment will provide valuable insights into how the design of a prompt can influence the output of a LLM, and can guide future efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these models.
