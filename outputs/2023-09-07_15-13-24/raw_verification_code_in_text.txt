This code will test the hypothesis that the specificity of prompts given to a Language Model (LLM) has a direct impact on the relevance of its generated responses. It uses a simple scoring system for specificity and relevance, generates responses from the LLM, calculates the correlation between specificity and relevance, and reports the results. Note that the human evaluation step is not included in the code as it involves manual labor.
