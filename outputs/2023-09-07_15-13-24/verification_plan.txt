Verification Plan:

1. Define Specificity and Relevance:
   1.1. Specificity: Define a scoring system to measure the specificity of a prompt. For instance, a prompt that explicitly asks for a numerical answer could be scored higher than a prompt that does not.
   1.2. Relevance: Define a scoring system to measure the relevance of a response. For instance, a response that directly answers the question could be scored higher than a response that includes extraneous information.

2. Create a Dataset:
   2.1. Generate a set of prompts with varying levels of specificity. For instance, for the question "What is 1 + 1?", prompts could range from "What is 1 + 1?" (low specificity) to "Calculate 1 + 1 and provide only the numerical answer" (high specificity).
   2.2. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and covers a wide range of topics and types of questions to ensure the results are generalizable.

3. Generate Responses:
   3.1. Input each prompt into the LLM and record the generated response.

4. Score Specificity and Relevance:
   4.1. Score the specificity of each prompt using the scoring system defined in step 1.1.
   4.2. Score the relevance of each response using the scoring system defined in step 1.2.

5. Analyze the Results:
   5.1. Calculate the correlation between the specificity scores and the relevance scores. This can be done using a statistical method such as Pearson's correlation.
   5.2. If the correlation is positive and statistically significant, this would support the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the specificity of a prompt and the relevance of a response.

6. Conduct a Human Evaluation:
   6.1. To further validate the results, conduct a human evaluation. Have human evaluators score the relevance of a subset of the responses.
   6.2. Compare the human scores to the scores generated in step 4.2. If they align, this would provide further support for the hypothesis.

7. Report the Results:
   7.1. Compile the results into a report that includes the methodology, results, and conclusions.
   7.2. Discuss any limitations of the study and potential areas for future research.

This plan will allow us to test the hypothesis that the specificity of prompts given to a Language Model (LLM) has a direct impact on the relevance of its generated responses. By systematically varying the specificity of the prompts and evaluating the relevance of the responses, we can determine whether there is a correlation between these two variables.
