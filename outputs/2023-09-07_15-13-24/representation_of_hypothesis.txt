Original Hypothesis:
Prompt Engineering: Modify the prompts given to the LLM to encourage it to generate more relevant responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Calculate 1 + 1 and provide only the numerical answer."

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of prompts given to a Language Model (LLM) has a direct impact on the relevance of its generated responses. In this context, specificity refers to the clarity and directness of the instruction given to the LLM. For instance, a more specific prompt such as "Calculate 1 + 1 and provide only the numerical answer" is hypothesized to yield more relevant responses than a less specific prompt like "What is 1 + 1?".

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let S be the specificity of a prompt and R be the relevance of the response. We hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between S and R, which can be represented as:

Corr(S, R) > 0

To test this hypothesis, we can conduct an experiment where we provide the LLM with a set of prompts with varying levels of specificity and then evaluate the relevance of the generated responses. The relevance can be evaluated using a predefined relevance score or through human evaluation. The results can then be analyzed to determine the correlation between the specificity of the prompts and the relevance of the responses.
