Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the prompts. This could help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the prompts.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could develop a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying the main subject and object of the sentence, or using named entity recognition to identify key pieces of information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM to generate more concise responses. This would involve providing positive reinforcement when the model generates a response that is directly related to the prompt, and negative reinforcement when it generates extraneous text.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to generating concise responses. For example, a transformer-based model might be more effective at this task than a recurrent neural network (RNN).

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a two-step process where the LLM first generates a response, and then a second model refines that response to remove any extraneous text. This second model could be trained on a dataset of LLM outputs and their corresponding refined versions.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that removes common phrases or sentences that are often generated by the LLM but are not directly related to the prompts. This would require a thorough analysis of the LLM's outputs to identify these common phrases or sentences.
