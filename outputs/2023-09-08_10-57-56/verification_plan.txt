Verification Plan:

1. Define the Experiment:
   1.1. Define a set of general prompts: These prompts should be general questions that can be answered numerically. For example, "What is 1 + 1?".
   1.2. Define a set of specific prompts: These prompts should be the same questions as the general prompts, but rephrased to be more specific. For example, "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

2. Conduct the Experiment:
   2.1. Input the general prompts into the LLM and record the responses.
   2.2. Input the specific prompts into the LLM and record the responses.

3. Analyze the Results:
   3.1. Categorize the responses from the general prompts into 'numerical only' and 'non-numerical' responses. Count the number of responses in each category.
   3.2. Categorize the responses from the specific prompts into 'numerical only' and 'non-numerical' responses. Count the number of responses in each category.
   3.3. Calculate the proportion of 'numerical only' responses for the general prompts (G) and the specific prompts (S).

4. Test the Hypothesis:
   4.1. Compare the proportions G and S. If S > G, then the hypothesis is supported. If S <= G, then the hypothesis is not supported.

5. Document the Results:
   5.1. Write a report detailing the experiment, the results, and whether the hypothesis was supported or not. Include the raw data, the categorized responses, and the calculated proportions.

6. Review and Refine:
   6.1. If the hypothesis is not supported, review the experiment to identify potential issues. Consider refining the prompts or the categorization method.
   6.2. If the hypothesis is supported, consider further experiments to refine the understanding of how prompt specificity influences LLM responses. For example, test different types of specificity (e.g., asking for a 'one-word answer' vs. a 'numerical answer') or different types of questions (e.g., math problems vs. trivia questions). 

This plan will allow us to test the hypothesis in a structured, systematic way, and will provide data that can be used to refine our understanding of how prompt specificity influences LLM responses.
