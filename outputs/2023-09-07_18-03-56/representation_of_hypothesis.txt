Original Hypothesis: 
One way to address this issue could be to refine the prompt given to the LLM. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to provide a more direct response.

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of the prompt given to a Language Learning Model (LLM) influences the directness of its response. For instance, when the prompt "What is 1 + 1?" is replaced with "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", the LLM is hypothesized to provide a more direct response. 

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative analysis method. We will use a set of mathematical questions, half of which will be phrased in a general way (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the other half in a more specific way (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"). The responses from the LLM will be evaluated based on their directness and accuracy. 

Mathematically, if we denote the set of general questions as G and the set of specific questions as S, and the directness of response as D (on a scale of 1 to 10), our hypothesis can be represented as:

Mean D(S) > Mean D(G)

This means that the average directness of responses to specific questions is greater than the average directness of responses to general questions.
