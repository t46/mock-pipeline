Original Hypothesis:
The prompt could be modified to ask for a more specific response. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of a question prompt directly influences the precision of the response. For instance, modifying a general question like "What is 1 + 1?" to a more specific one such as "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" will yield a more precise numerical answer.

To test this hypothesis, we could conduct an experiment where a group of participants are given both general and specific prompts and their responses are recorded. The precision of the responses can then be quantified and compared between the two types of prompts. 

Mathematically, this could be represented as:

Let G represent the set of responses to the general prompt and S represent the set of responses to the specific prompt. The precision of responses can be quantified as the variance (Var) in the responses. The hypothesis can then be tested by comparing Var(G) and Var(S). If Var(S) < Var(G), the hypothesis is supported. 

In a computer program, this could be implemented as a function that takes as input a list of responses to each prompt and outputs the variance of the responses. The function could then be used to compare the variance of the responses to the two prompts.
