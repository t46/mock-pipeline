1. Improve Training Data: The LLM could be trained on a dataset where the answers are given in a more direct format. This could help the model learn to provide more concise responses.

2. Modify the Prompt: The prompt could be modified to ask for a more specific response. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

3. Post-Processing: Develop a more sophisticated post-processing method that can handle a wider range of responses. This could involve natural language processing techniques to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output.

4. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where the LLM is corrected when it provides extraneous information. This could help the model learn over time to provide more concise responses.

5. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the LLM on a specific task. For example, if the task is to answer math problems, the model could be fine-tuned on a dataset of math problems and their answers.

6. Use of Reinforcement Learning: Implement a reinforcement learning approach where the model is rewarded for providing concise, direct answers and penalized for providing extraneous information.

7. Use of a Secondary Model: Implement a secondary model whose task is to trim the output of the LLM to the most relevant information.

8. Modify the Model Architecture: Modify the architecture of the LLM to include an attention mechanism or other component that can help the model focus on the most relevant information.

9. Use of a Preprocessing Layer: Implement a preprocessing layer that can interpret the prompt and modify it to be more specific, thus guiding the LLM to provide a more direct response.
