Original Hypothesis:
4. Prompt Engineering: Modify the prompts to guide the LLM to produce more specific responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of responses generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM) can be improved by modifying the input prompts. For instance, a more specific prompt such as "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" is hypothesized to yield a more specific response than a general prompt like "What is 1 + 1?".

To test this hypothesis, we can use a set of general prompts (P_G) and a set of specific prompts (P_S) and compare the specificity of the responses generated by the LLM. The specificity of a response can be quantified using a specificity score (S), which can be calculated using a suitable metric such as the number of non-generic words in the response or the length of the response.

Mathematically, the hypothesis can be expressed as follows:

For all prompts p in P_G and P_S, if p is in P_S, then the specificity score S of the response to p is greater than the specificity score of the response to the corresponding prompt in P_G.

This can be written as:

∀p (p ∈ P_G ∪ P_S) (p ∈ P_S → S(response to p) > S(response to corresponding prompt in P_G)).

This hypothesis can be tested by running the LLM with the prompts in P_G and P_S, calculating the specificity scores of the responses, and comparing the scores. If the hypothesis is correct, the scores for the responses to the prompts in P_S should be higher than the scores for the responses to the prompts in P_G.
