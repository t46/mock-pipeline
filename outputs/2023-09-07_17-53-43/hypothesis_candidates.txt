1. Improve Training Data: The LLM could be trained on a dataset where the answers are given in the desired format. This would help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the instructions.

2. Post-Processing Algorithms: Develop more sophisticated post-processing algorithms that can extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the key information.

3. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the LLM on a specific task. For example, if the task is to answer math problems, fine-tune the model on a dataset of math problems and answers. This could help the model learn to generate more relevant responses.

4. Prompt Engineering: Modify the prompts to guide the LLM to produce more specific responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

5. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where the LLM learns from its mistakes. If the model produces an incorrect or irrelevant response, this information could be fed back into the model to improve future responses.

6. Multi-Stage Model: Implement a multi-stage model where the first stage generates a response and the second stage refines the response to ensure it is directly related to the instructions.

7. Use of Reinforcement Learning: Train the LLM using reinforcement learning techniques, where the model is rewarded for producing responses that are directly related to the instructions and penalized for producing irrelevant responses.

8. Use of Attention Mechanisms: Implement attention mechanisms in the LLM to help it focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating a response.

9. Use of Conditional Generation: Implement conditional generation in the LLM, where the model is given not just the input but also a condition that the output must satisfy. For example, the condition could be that the output must be a single number.
