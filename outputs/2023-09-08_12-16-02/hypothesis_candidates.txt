Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the questions. This could help the model learn to respond with only the relevant information.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response and removing any extraneous information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it provides a direct answer and penalize it when it includes extraneous information. This could help the model learn to respond more directly to prompts.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to providing direct responses. For example, we could use a sequence-to-sequence model that is trained to map input sequences to output sequences.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a hybrid approach, combining the LLM with a rule-based system. The rule-based system could be used to filter out any extraneous information from the LLM's output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a supervised learning approach, where we manually label a set of responses as being either direct or indirect. We could then train the LLM to classify its own responses in the same way, and use this to guide its output.
