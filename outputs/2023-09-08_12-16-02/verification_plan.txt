Verification Plan:

1. Preparation of Test Data:
   1.1. Prepare a set of 100 prompts, 50 of which are general (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and 50 of which are specific (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1").
   1.2. Ensure that the prompts are diverse and cover a wide range of topics and complexities to ensure the results are not biased towards a specific type of question.

2. Execution of Test:
   2.1. Input the general prompts into the LLM and record the responses.
   2.2. Input the specific prompts into the LLM and record the responses.

3. Analysis of Results:
   3.1. Categorize the responses from the LLM as numerical or non-numerical.
   3.2. Calculate the percentage of numerical responses for the general prompts. This can be done by dividing the number of numerical responses by the total number of general prompts and multiplying by 100.
   3.3. Calculate the percentage of numerical responses for the specific prompts. This can be done by dividing the number of numerical responses by the total number of specific prompts and multiplying by 100.

4. Verification of Hypothesis:
   4.1. If the percentage of numerical responses for the specific prompts is greater than 80%, then the hypothesis is verified.
   4.2. If the percentage of numerical responses for the specific prompts is less than or equal to 80%, then the hypothesis is not verified.

5. Documentation of Results:
   5.1. Document the results of the experiment, including the prompts used, the responses from the LLM, the categorization of the responses, and the calculated percentages.
   5.2. If the hypothesis is verified, document the potential implications for the use of the LLM and any recommendations for future use.
   5.3. If the hypothesis is not verified, document potential reasons why and any recommendations for future experiments or modifications to the LLM.

6. Review and Feedback:
   6.1. Share the results with the team and stakeholders for review and feedback.
   6.2. Discuss potential improvements to the LLM based on the results and feedback.
   6.3. Plan for the implementation of any agreed-upon improvements to the LLM.
