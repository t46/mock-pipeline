Original Hypothesis: 
The hypothesis suggests that refining the prompt given to the Language Learning Model (LLM) can influence its response. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" This might encourage the model to respond with just "2".

Refined Hypothesis:
The hypothesis can be refined and made more specific by defining the parameters of the LLM, the nature of the prompts, and the expected responses. 

Hypothesis: The specificity of the prompt given to a Language Learning Model (LLM) influences the precision of its response. If the prompt is more specific, such as "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?", the LLM is more likely to respond with a precise answer, "2", as opposed to a more elaborate response.

Mathematical Representation:
Let P be the prompt specificity, R be the response precision, and LLM be the Language Learning Model. The hypothesis can be represented as:

If P increases, then R in LLM increases.

This can be represented mathematically as:

P ‚àù R (P is directly proportional to R)

This means that as the specificity of the prompt (P) increases, the precision of the response (R) from the LLM also increases.
