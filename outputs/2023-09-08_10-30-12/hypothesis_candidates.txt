1. Hypothesis: Training the LLM with more specific prompts could help it generate more precise responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number "2".

2. Hypothesis: We could develop a secondary AI model that is trained to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This model would be trained on a dataset of LLM outputs and their corresponding correct responses, learning to identify and extract the relevant parts of the LLM's responses.

3. Hypothesis: We could implement a reward system during the training of the LLM, where the model is rewarded for providing concise and direct answers and penalized for providing extraneous information. This could be done using reinforcement learning techniques.

4. Hypothesis: We could modify the LLM's architecture to include an attention mechanism that focuses on the most relevant parts of the input when generating the output. This could help the model to better understand the context of the question and provide a more direct answer.

5. Hypothesis: We could use a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, or semantic role labeling.

6. Hypothesis: We could use a combination of the above methods, such as training the LLM with more specific prompts and also using a secondary AI model to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could provide a more robust solution to the problem.
