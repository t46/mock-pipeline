Verification Plan:

1. Define the Specificity Scoring System:
   1.1. Develop a scoring system to quantify the specificity of prompts. For example, a prompt like "What is 1 + 1?" might be assigned a score of 1 (low specificity), while "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" might be assigned a score of 2 (high specificity).
   1.2. Ensure that the scoring system is consistent and can be applied to a wide range of prompts.

2. Prepare the Dataset:
   2.1. Create a dataset of prompts with varying levels of specificity, ensuring that each level of specificity is well-represented in the dataset.
   2.2. Assign a specificity score to each prompt using the scoring system developed in step 1.
   2.3. For each prompt, include the correct response for later comparison.

3. Train the LLM:
   3.1. Train the LLM with the dataset created in step 2.
   3.2. Ensure that the training process is consistent across all prompts, regardless of their specificity score.

4. Test the LLM:
   4.1. After training, input the prompts into the LLM and record the responses.
   4.2. For each response, determine whether it is correct by comparing it to the correct response included in the dataset.

5. Measure Precision:
   5.1. For each level of specificity, calculate the precision of the responses. Precision can be quantified as the percentage of correct responses.
   5.2. Record the precision for each level of specificity.

6. Analyze the Results:
   6.1. Plot the specificity scores (S) against the precision (P) to visualize the relationship between them.
   6.2. Calculate the correlation coefficient between S and P to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.
   6.3. If the correlation is positive and statistically significant, this would support the hypothesis that the precision of responses is directly proportional to the specificity of the prompts.

7. Draw Conclusions:
   7.1. Based on the results of the analysis, determine whether the evidence supports the hypothesis.
   7.2. If the evidence does not support the hypothesis, consider alternative explanations or modifications to the hypothesis.
   7.3. Document the findings and conclusions, including any limitations or uncertainties in the study.

8. Repeat the Experiment:
   8.1. To ensure the reliability of the results, repeat the experiment multiple times with different datasets.
   8.2. If the results are consistent across multiple experiments, this would provide stronger evidence for the hypothesis.
