Original Hypothesis:
Training the LLM with more specific prompts could help it generate more precise responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number "2".

Refined Hypothesis:
The precision of responses generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM) is directly proportional to the specificity of the prompts used in training. In this context, specificity refers to the clarity and directness of the question or prompt. For instance, a more specific prompt would be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" instead of "What is 1 + 1?". The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the precision of responses to both specific and non-specific prompts.

Mathematical Representation:
Let's denote the precision of responses as P, and the specificity of prompts as S. The hypothesis can be represented as P ‚àù S. To test this hypothesis, we can measure P for different levels of S and look for a positive correlation. 

In this case, precision (P) can be quantified as the percentage of correct responses, and specificity (S) can be quantified using a scoring system that assigns higher scores to more specific prompts. For example, a prompt like "What is 1 + 1?" might be assigned a score of 1 (low specificity), while "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" might be assigned a score of 2 (high specificity). 

The hypothesis can be tested by training the LLM with prompts of different specificity scores, and then measuring the precision of the responses. If the hypothesis is correct, we should observe a positive correlation between S and P.
