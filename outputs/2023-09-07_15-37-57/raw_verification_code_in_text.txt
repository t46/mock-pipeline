import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from transformers import GPT4LMHeadModel, GPT4Tokenizer

# 1. Data Preparation
# Assuming we have a csv file 'qa_dataset.csv' with two columns 'question' and 'answer'
dataset = pd.read_csv('qa_dataset.csv')

# 1.1. Prepare a dataset of questions and answers
questions = dataset['question']
answers = dataset['answer']

# 1.2. Split the dataset into two equal parts: one for training and one for testing
train_questions, test_questions, train_answers, test_answers = train_test_split(questions, answers, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# 2. Prompt Preparation
# 2.1. For the first part of the dataset, prepare general prompts
general_prompts = train_questions

# 2.2. For the second part of the dataset, prepare specific prompts
specific_prompts = ["Provide the numerical answer to " + q if "1 + 1" in q else q for q in train_questions]

# 3. Model Training
# 3.1. Train two versions of the LLM (GPT-4) separately
tokenizer = GPT4Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt-4')

# Training with general prompts
model_general = GPT4LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt-4')
model_general.train(general_prompts)

# Training with specific prompts
model_specific = GPT4LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt-4')
model_specific.train(specific_prompts)

# 4. Model Testing
# 4.1. Test both models on the testing dataset
general_responses = model_general.predict(test_questions)
specific_responses = model_specific.predict(test_questions)

# 5. Response Evaluation
# 5.1. Evaluate the precision of the responses from both models
general_precision = precision_score(test_answers, general_responses)
specific_precision = precision_score(test_answers, specific_responses)

# 6. Hypothesis Testing
# 6.1. Compare the precision scores of the two models
print(f"General model precision: {general_precision}")
print(f"Specific model precision: {specific_precision}")

# 6.2. Perform a statistical test (such as a t-test) to determine if the difference in precision scores is statistically significant
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(general_responses, specific_responses)
print(f"p-value: {p_val}")

# 7. Report Findings
# 7.1. Document the process and results of the experiment
# 7.2. If the hypothesis is supported, provide recommendations for improving the precision of LLM responses
# 7.3. If the hypothesis is not supported, suggest alternative strategies for improving precision and propose new hypotheses for future testing

Please note that the code above is a simplified representation of the process and does not include all the necessary steps and checks that should be performed during the actual experiment. For example, the training process of the GPT-4 model is not as simple as calling a `train` method. It involves setting up a training loop, defining a loss function, and more. Also, the `predict` method does not exist in the GPT-4 model and is used here as a placeholder for the actual prediction process.
