1. Hypothesis: Training the LLM with more specific prompts could help it generate more precise responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number "2".

2. Hypothesis: We could develop a secondary AI model that is trained to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This model would be trained on a dataset of LLM outputs and their corresponding correct responses, learning to identify and extract the relevant parts of the output.

3. Hypothesis: We could modify the LLM's loss function during training to penalize extraneous output. This would involve creating a custom loss function that increases the model's loss when it generates text that is not directly related to the prompt.

4. Hypothesis: We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. The model would receive a reward when it generates a response that matches the correct answer exactly, and a penalty when it generates extraneous text. Over time, this could encourage the model to generate more precise responses.

5. Hypothesis: We could use a technique called "fine-tuning" to train the LLM on a specific task. For example, if we want the model to answer math problems, we could fine-tune it on a dataset of math problems and their correct answers. This could help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the prompt.

6. Hypothesis: We could use a post-processing method that is more flexible and can handle a variety of outputs. For example, we could use natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the relevant parts of the LLM's output, regardless of what extraneous text is present.
