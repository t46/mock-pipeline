Original Hypothesis:
Training the LLM with more specific prompts could help it generate more precise responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number "2".

Refined Hypothesis:
The precision of responses generated by a Language Learning Model (LLM) is directly proportional to the specificity of the prompts used in training. In this context, precision refers to the degree to which the response aligns with the expected answer, and specificity refers to the level of detail and clarity in the training prompts. 

For instance, consider the prompt "What is 1 + 1?". A more specific version of this prompt would be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". The hypothesis predicts that the LLM trained with the latter prompt will be more likely to respond with the precise answer "2", rather than a less precise response such as "The answer is 2".

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let P be the precision of responses, and S be the specificity of prompts. The hypothesis can be expressed as:

P ‚àù S

This means that as S increases, P should also increase, indicating that more specific prompts lead to more precise responses. 

To test this hypothesis, we could conduct an experiment where we train two versions of the same LLM, one with general prompts and one with specific prompts, and then compare the precision of their responses.
