Verification Plan:

1. **Data Collection:**
    1.1. Collect a large set of general prompts that are typically used with the LLM. These prompts should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics.
    1.2. For each general prompt, create a corresponding specific prompt. The specific prompt should ask for the same information as the general prompt but in a more direct and specific way.

2. **Experiment Setup:**
    2.1. Divide the prompts into two groups: one for the general prompts and one for the specific prompts.
    2.2. Ensure that the LLM is set up and ready for testing. 

3. **Running the Experiment:**
    3.1. Input each general prompt from the first group into the LLM and record the output.
    3.2. Repeat the process with the specific prompts from the second group.

4. **Data Analysis:**
    4.1. Categorize the responses from the LLM into numerical and non-numerical responses. 
    4.2. Calculate the proportion of numerical responses for the general prompts and the specific prompts.
    4.3. Use a chi-square test for independence to compare the proportions of numerical responses for the general and specific prompts.

5. **Hypothesis Testing:**
    5.1. If the p-value from the chi-square test is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the specificity of a prompt does influence the type of response from the LLM.
    5.2. If the p-value from the chi-square test is greater than the significance level, do not reject the null hypothesis. This would suggest that the specificity of a prompt does not significantly influence the type of response from the LLM.

6. **Report Findings:**
    6.1. Document the entire process, from the collection of prompts to the statistical analysis.
    6.2. Clearly state the findings and whether the hypothesis was supported or not.
    6.3. Discuss potential implications of the findings and any limitations of the study.
    6.4. Suggest future research directions based on the findings.

This plan will allow us to test the hypothesis in a systematic and rigorous manner. It will provide valuable insights into how the specificity of a prompt influences the type of response from the LLM.
