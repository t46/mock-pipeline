1. Hypothesis: Fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers could help the model learn to generate more concise responses. This would involve creating a dataset where the prompts are questions and the responses are the direct answers, without any extraneous text.

2. Hypothesis: Implementing a reward system during the training process could help guide the model to produce more concise responses. This could involve using reinforcement learning techniques where the model is rewarded for producing direct answers and penalized for extraneous text.

3. Hypothesis: Developing a post-processing method that uses natural language understanding to extract the relevant information from the model's output could help solve the problem. This could involve using techniques such as named entity recognition or information extraction to identify and extract the direct answer from the model's output.

4. Hypothesis: Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer could help guide the model to produce more direct responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Give a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

5. Hypothesis: Implementing a system that uses a secondary model to evaluate the output of the LLM could help solve the problem. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the relevant information from the LLM's output.

6. Hypothesis: Using a different model architecture that is more suited to generating concise responses could help solve the problem. This could involve exploring other types of language models or transformer architectures that are better at generating concise responses.

7. Hypothesis: Implementing a system that uses a combination of the above strategies could help solve the problem. This could involve fine-tuning the LLM, modifying the prompt, and developing a post-processing method that uses natural language understanding.
