Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Prepare a dataset of questions that can be answered in one word or a short phrase. The dataset should be large enough to provide statistically significant results. For example, a dataset of 1000 questions could be used.
   1.2. Divide the dataset into two equal parts. One part will be used for the standard prompt and the other for the concise prompt.

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. For the first half of the dataset, use the standard prompt format. For example, "What is 1 + 1?".
   2.2. For the second half of the dataset, modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, "Give a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".
   2.3. Input these prompts into the LLM and record the responses.

3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. Measure the length of each response from the LLM. This can be done by counting the number of words in each response.
   3.2. Calculate the mean length of responses (μ1) to the standard prompt and the mean length of responses (μ2) to the concise prompt.

4. Hypothesis Testing:
   4.1. Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two samples. The null hypothesis (H0) is that μ1 = μ2, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that μ1 ≠ μ2.
   4.2. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis. This would suggest that the specificity of a prompt does influence the conciseness of the model's response.

5. Result Interpretation:
   5.1. If the null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer does guide the model to produce more direct responses.
   5.2. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, conclude that modifying the prompt does not significantly affect the conciseness of the model's response.

6. Report Writing:
   6.1. Document the entire process, from data collection to result interpretation, in a report. Include details about the dataset, the experiment setup, the statistical analysis, and the conclusions drawn from the hypothesis testing.
   6.2. Share the report with stakeholders and discuss the implications of the findings for future use of the LLM.
