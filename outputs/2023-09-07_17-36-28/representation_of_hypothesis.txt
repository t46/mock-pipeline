Original Hypothesis:
Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer could help guide the model to produce more direct responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Give a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of a prompt directly influences the conciseness of the model's response. If a prompt is modified to explicitly request a concise answer, the model will produce a more direct response. This can be tested by comparing the responses to two different prompts: "What is 1 + 1?" and "Give a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". The hypothesis can be represented as:

H0: μ1 = μ2
H1: μ1 ≠ μ2

Where:
H0 = Null Hypothesis: The mean length of responses (μ1) to the standard prompt is equal to the mean length of responses (μ2) to the concise prompt.
H1 = Alternative Hypothesis: The mean length of responses (μ1) to the standard prompt is not equal to the mean length of responses (μ2) to the concise prompt.

The hypothesis can be tested using a two-sample t-test, where the two samples are the lengths of the responses to the two different prompts. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer does guide the model to produce more direct responses.
