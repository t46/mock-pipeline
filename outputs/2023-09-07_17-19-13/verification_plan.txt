Verification Plan:

1. Dataset Preparation:
    1.1. Prepare two sets of datasets: one for training and one for testing. The datasets should contain a variety of questions that can be answered in one word.
    1.2. For the training dataset, structure the questions in the specific prompt structure defined in the hypothesis, i.e., "Provide a one-word answer: [Question]?".
    1.3. For the testing dataset, structure the questions in the same way.

2. Training the LLM:
    2.1. Train the LLM using the training dataset prepared in step 1. 
    2.2. Ensure that the LLM is trained until it reaches a satisfactory level of performance on the training dataset.

3. Control Group:
    3.1. Prepare a control group of LLMs that are trained with standard prompt structures, i.e., without the directive for a one-word answer.
    3.2. Ensure that the control group LLMs are trained until they reach a satisfactory level of performance on their respective training datasets.

4. Testing:
    4.1. Test the LLM trained with the specific prompt structure using the testing dataset prepared in step 1. Record the word count of each answer.
    4.2. Test the control group LLMs using the same testing dataset. Record the word count of each answer.

5. Data Analysis:
    5.1. Calculate the average word count of answers from the LLM trained with the specific prompt structure (A).
    5.2. Calculate the average word count of answers from the control group LLMs (B).
    5.3. Compare A and B. If A < B, the hypothesis is supported; the LLM trained with the specific prompt structure provides more concise answers.

6. Evaluation:
    6.1. Evaluate the quality of the answers. Ensure that the LLM trained with the specific prompt structure is not only providing more concise answers but also correct ones.
    6.2. If the LLM trained with the specific prompt structure provides more concise and correct answers, the hypothesis is confirmed.

7. Reporting:
    7.1. Document the entire process, including the preparation of datasets, training and testing procedures, data analysis, and evaluation.
    7.2. Report the results in a clear and concise manner, highlighting whether the hypothesis was confirmed or not.
