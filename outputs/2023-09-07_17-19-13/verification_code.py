# 1. Dataset Preparation
questions = [...]  # list of questions that can be answered in one word
answers = [...]  # corresponding list of one-word answers

# 1.1. Prepare two sets of datasets: one for training and one for testing.

# 1.3. For the testing dataset, structure the questions in the same way.

# 2. Training the LLM
# 2.1. Train the LLM using the training dataset prepared in step 1.

# 3. Control Group
# Prepare a control group of LLMs and train them in a similar way, but without the specific prompt structure

# 4. Testing
# Test the LLM and the control group LLMs using the testing dataset and record the word count of each answer

# 5. Data Analysis
# Calculate the average word count of answers from the LLM and the control group LLMs

# 6. Evaluation
# Evaluate the quality of the answers

# 7. Reporting
# Document the entire process and report the results
