Hypothesis 1: 
We could train the LLM with a more specific prompt structure that encourages it to provide concise answers. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a feedback loop where the LLM learns from its previous outputs. If the output is not directly related to the instructions, the model is corrected and learns to provide more relevant responses over time.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could use a secondary model to post-process the LLM's output. This model would be trained to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output, regardless of any extraneous text.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could modify the LLM's architecture to include an attention mechanism that focuses on the most relevant parts of the input when generating the output.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. The model would be rewarded when it provides a direct answer and penalized when it includes extraneous information.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based system to post-process the LLM's output. This system would use a set of predefined rules to extract the relevant information from the output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning part would ensure that the model learns to provide direct answers, while the unsupervised learning part would allow the model to generalize to new inputs.
