Verification Plan:

1. **Preparation of Test Data:**
    1.1. Prepare a set of mathematical questions. The number of questions should be statistically significant. For instance, we could use 1000 questions.
    1.2. For each question, prepare two versions of prompts: a general version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and a specific version (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1").
    1.3. Prepare the correct numerical answers for each question.

2. **Execution of Test:**
    2.1. Input the general version of the prompts to the LLM and record the responses. Store these responses in a list or database for later analysis.
    2.2. Repeat the process with the specific version of the prompts and record the responses.

3. **Analysis of Results:**
    3.1. For each set of responses (general and specific), count the number of responses that are purely numerical.
    3.2. Calculate the percentage of purely numerical responses for each set.

4. **Comparison and Conclusion:**
    4.1. Compare the percentage of purely numerical responses between the general and specific prompts.
    4.2. If the percentage of purely numerical responses is significantly higher for the specific prompts than for the general prompts, then the hypothesis is supported.
    4.3. If there is no significant difference, or if the percentage is higher for the general prompts, then the hypothesis is not supported.

5. **Further Analysis:**
    5.1. If the hypothesis is supported, further analysis could be conducted to determine the degree of specificity required to elicit a purely numerical response.
    5.2. If the hypothesis is not supported, alternative hypotheses could be developed and tested. For example, it could be hypothesized that the length of the prompt, rather than its specificity, influences the type of response.

6. **Documentation:**
    6.1. Document the entire process, including the preparation of test data, the execution of the test, the analysis of results, and the conclusions drawn.
    6.2. This documentation will be useful for future reference and for anyone who wishes to replicate the experiment.
