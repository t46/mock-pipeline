Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the prompts. This could help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the prompts.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could develop a more sophisticated post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response and discarding the rest.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it generates responses that are directly related to the prompts and penalize it when it generates extraneous text.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to this task. For example, we could use a sequence-to-sequence model that is designed to generate responses that are directly related to the input.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a hybrid approach that combines several of these strategies. For example, we could refine the prompts, train the LLM on a more appropriate dataset, and use a sophisticated post-processing method to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output.
