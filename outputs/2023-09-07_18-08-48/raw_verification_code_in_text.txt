# Step 1: Define Specificity
# This is a theoretical step and does not require code implementation

# Step 2: Create a Dataset
# Assuming we have a dataset in CSV format with columns 'Prompt', 'Specificity_Score', 'Ideal_Response_Type'
dataset = pd.read_csv('prompts_dataset.csv')

# Step 3: Generate Responses
# Assuming we have a function generate_response that takes a prompt and returns a response from the LLM
def generate_response(prompt):
    # This function should be implemented based on the specific LLM being used
    pass

# Generate responses for all prompts and store them in the dataset
dataset['LLM_Response'] = dataset['Prompt'].apply(generate_response)

# Step 4: Analyze Responses
# Assuming we have a function classify_response that takes a response and returns its type
def classify_response(response):
    # This function should be implemented based on the specific classification model being used
    pass

# Classify all responses and store them in the dataset
dataset['Actual_Response_Type'] = dataset['LLM_Response'].apply(classify_response)

# Compare the actual response type with the ideal response type and record whether they match
dataset['Match'] = dataset['Ideal_Response_Type'] == dataset['Actual_Response_Type']

# Step 5: Test Hypothesis
# Calculate the correlation between the specificity score and the match
correlation, _ = pearsonr(dataset['Specificity_Score'], dataset['Match'])
print('Correlation: ', correlation)

# Perform a regression analysis
X = dataset['Specificity_Score'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = dataset['Match']

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Step 6: Report Results
# Compile the results into a report
# This is a theoretical step and does not require code implementation

# Include visualizations
sns.scatterplot(data=dataset, x='Specificity_Score', y='Match')
plt.show()

# Step 7: Review and Refine
# Based on the results, refine the hypothesis if necessary and repeat the verification process
# This is a theoretical step and does not require code implementation
