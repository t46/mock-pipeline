Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the answers are only the direct responses to the questions. This could help the model learn to respond more directly.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response and removing any extraneous information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it provides a direct answer and penalize it when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing direct answers. For example, a transformer-based model might be more effective at this task.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of the above methods. For example, we could refine the prompts, train the LLM on a more specific dataset, and use a post-processing method to extract the most relevant information.
