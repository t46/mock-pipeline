Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the model with a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers. This could help the model learn to respond with only the relevant information.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the model's output. This could involve identifying and extracting the key information from the sentence.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model. We could reward the model when it provides only the direct answer and penalize it when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing direct answers. For example, a model that is specifically designed for question answering tasks might be more appropriate.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a hybrid approach, combining the LLM with a rule-based system. The rule-based system could be used to filter out the extraneous information from the LLM's output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model that has been fine-tuned on a similar task. For example, a model that has been trained to answer math problems might be more likely to provide just the numerical answer. 

Hypothesis 8: 
We could implement a system that allows for user feedback. Users could indicate whether the model's response was helpful or not, and this information could be used to improve the model's performance.
