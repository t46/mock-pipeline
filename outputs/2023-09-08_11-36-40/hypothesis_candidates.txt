1. Improve Training Data: The LLM could be trained on a dataset where the answers are given in the desired format. This would help the model learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the instructions.

2. Post-Processing Algorithms: Develop more sophisticated post-processing algorithms that can extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the key information.

3. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the LLM on a specific task. For example, if the task is to answer math problems, fine-tune the model on a dataset of math problems and answers. This could help the model learn to generate more relevant responses.

4. Prompt Engineering: Modify the prompts given to the LLM to encourage it to generate more relevant responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Calculate 1 + 1 and provide only the numerical answer."

5. Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where the LLM's output is evaluated and the feedback is used to adjust the model's parameters. This could help the model learn to generate more relevant responses over time.

6. Multi-Stage Model: Implement a multi-stage model where the first stage generates a response and the second stage filters or modifies the response to ensure it is directly related to the instructions.

7. Use of Attention Mechanisms: Implement attention mechanisms in the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating a response.

8. Use of Reinforcement Learning: Implement reinforcement learning techniques where the model is rewarded for generating responses that are directly related to the instructions and penalized for generating extraneous text.
