Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the model with a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers. This could help the model learn to respond with only the relevant information.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the model's output. This could involve identifying and extracting the key information from the sentence.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model. We could reward the model when it provides only the direct answer and penalize it when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing short, direct answers. For example, a transformer-based model might be more suitable than a recurrent neural network.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task. For example, if we are asking math questions, we could use a model that has been trained on a dataset of math problems and answers.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a hybrid approach, combining several of the above methods. For example, we could refine the prompts, train the model with a suitable dataset, and use a post-processing method to extract the most relevant information.
