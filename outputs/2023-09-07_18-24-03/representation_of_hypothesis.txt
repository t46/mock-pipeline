Original Hypothesis:
Refining the prompts to be more specific, such as asking "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" instead of "What is 1 + 1?", might encourage the model to respond with just the number.

Refined Hypothesis:
The specificity of a prompt directly influences the precision of a model's response. In the context of numerical problems, if a prompt is phrased to explicitly request a numerical answer (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"), the model is more likely to respond with a numerical answer only (e.g., "2"), as opposed to a more verbose response (e.g., "The answer is 2").

Mathematical Representation:
Let P be the precision of the model's response, and S be the specificity of the prompt. We hypothesize that there is a direct relationship between P and S, which can be represented as:

P = f(S)

Where f is a function representing the relationship between P and S. The exact form of f can be determined through empirical testing and data analysis.
