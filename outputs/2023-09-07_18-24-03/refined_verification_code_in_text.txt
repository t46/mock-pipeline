# Documentation
# This code documents the entire process, including the hypothesis, verification plan, data collection, experiment, data analysis, and results.
# Any challenges encountered, how they were addressed, and any limitations of the study would be documented in comments or additional print statements.
# The findings would be shared with the team and discussed in a meeting or report.
