Verification Plan:

1. Define the Metrics:
   1.1. Precision of Response (P): This can be defined as the ratio of the number of responses that are strictly numerical to the total number of responses.
   1.2. Specificity of Prompt (S): This can be defined qualitatively. For instance, a prompt asking for a numerical answer can be considered more specific than a prompt asking a general question.

2. Data Collection:
   2.1. Create a dataset of mathematical problems that can be solved by the LLM. The problems should be diverse and cover different areas of mathematics to ensure the results are generalizable.
   2.2. For each problem, create two versions of the prompt: a general version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and a specific version (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1").

3. Experiment:
   3.1. Input the general version of the prompts to the LLM and record the responses.
   3.2. Calculate the precision of the responses (P1) using the metric defined in step 1.1.
   3.3. Repeat steps 3.1 and 3.2 with the specific version of the prompts and calculate the precision of the responses (P2).

4. Data Analysis:
   4.1. Compare the precision of the responses (P1 and P2) for the general and specific prompts.
   4.2. Use statistical tests (e.g., t-test) to determine if the difference in precision is statistically significant.

5. Hypothesis Testing:
   5.1. If the precision of the responses to the specific prompts (P2) is significantly higher than the precision of the responses to the general prompts (P1), then the hypothesis is supported.
   5.2. If there is no significant difference in precision, or if the precision of the responses to the general prompts (P1) is higher, then the hypothesis is not supported.

6. Refinement:
   6.1. If the hypothesis is not supported, refine the hypothesis based on the results and repeat the verification process.
   6.2. If the hypothesis is supported, further testing can be done with different types of problems and prompts to further validate and generalize the findings.

7. Documentation:
   7.1. Document the entire process, including the hypothesis, verification plan, data collection, experiment, data analysis, and results.
   7.2. Make sure to include any challenges encountered, how they were addressed, and any limitations of the study.
   7.3. Share the findings with the team and discuss potential implications for improving the performance of the LLM.
