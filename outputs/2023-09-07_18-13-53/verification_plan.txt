Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Collect a diverse set of questions that can be answered by the LLM. These questions should cover a wide range of topics and complexity levels. Let's denote this set as Q.
   1.2. For each question in Q, create a modified version that instructs the LLM to provide a one-word answer. Let's denote this set as Q'.

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. Divide the sets Q and Q' into two groups: a training set (80% of the data) and a testing set (20% of the data).
   2.2. Input each question from the training set of Q into the LLM and record the responses. Denote this set of responses as R.
   2.3. Similarly, input each question from the training set of Q' into the LLM and record the responses. Denote this set of responses as R'.

3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. Calculate the length of each response in R and R'. The length can be measured in terms of the number of words or characters, depending on the level of granularity desired.
   3.2. Calculate the average length of the responses in R and R'. Denote these as L and L' respectively.
   3.3. Compare L and L'. If L' â‰¤ L, it supports the hypothesis that modifying the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a more direct answer results in more concise responses.

4. Model Validation:
   4.1. Repeat steps 2.2 and 3.1-3.3 with the testing set of Q and Q'. This will help validate whether the findings from the training set hold true for unseen data as well.

5. Result Interpretation:
   5.1. If the results from both the training and testing sets support the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is likely correct.
   5.2. If the results do not support the hypothesis, further investigation will be needed to understand why. This could involve examining the types of questions for which the hypothesis does not hold, or exploring other potential factors that could influence the length of the LLM's responses.

6. Documentation:
   6.1. Document all the steps, methodologies, and findings in a detailed report. This report should include the data collection process, the experiment setup, the data analysis methods, the results, and the interpretation of the results. This will ensure that the verification process is transparent and can be replicated by others.
