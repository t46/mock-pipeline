Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a more direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the prompt to instruct the Language Learning Model (LLM) to provide a more direct answer will result in more concise responses. For instance, changing the question from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" will yield a single-word response from the LLM.

Mathematical Representation:
Let's denote the length of the response from the LLM as L. The hypothesis can be represented as:

If Q is a question asked to the LLM and Q' is the same question modified to request a one-word answer, then the length of the response to Q' (denoted as L') will be less than or equal to the length of the response to Q (denoted as L). In mathematical terms, L' â‰¤ L.

This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the lengths of the responses to a set of questions Q and their modified versions Q'. If the hypothesis is correct, the average length of the responses to Q' should be less than or equal to the average length of the responses to Q.
