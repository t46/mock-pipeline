Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that only contains direct answers to the prompts. This way, the model might learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another language model to extract the most relevant information from the output. This model could be trained to identify and extract the key information from a larger text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a more direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By providing rewards for concise and direct answers and penalties for extraneous information, the model might learn to generate more focused responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to train the LLM. The supervised learning could be used to teach the model to generate direct answers, while the unsupervised learning could be used to help the model generalize this ability to new prompts.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could implement a system that uses a combination of keyword extraction and semantic analysis to identify the most relevant part of the LLM's output. This system could then remove any extraneous information from the output.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a multi-stage approach where the LLM first generates a larger text and then a second model, trained specifically for this task, condenses this text into a more direct answer.
