Original Hypothesis:
The hypothesis suggests that refining prompts to be more specific, such as changing "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", might encourage the Language Learning Model (LLM) to respond with just the number.

Refined Hypothesis:
The hypothesis can be refined and made more specific by defining the expected outcome and the method of measurement. 

Refined Hypothesis: If the prompts given to the Language Learning Model (LLM) are more specific, such as changing "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", then the LLM will respond with a numerical answer in more than 80% of the cases.

This hypothesis can be tested by conducting an experiment where the LLM is given a set of questions, half of which are phrased in the traditional way (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the other half are phrased in the more specific way (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1"). The responses can then be analyzed to determine the percentage of cases in which the LLM responds with a numerical answer. 

Mathematical Representation:
Let T be the total number of questions, N be the number of questions phrased in the new way, and R be the number of responses that are numerical. The hypothesis can be represented mathematically as:

If N > T/2, then R/N > 0.8.
