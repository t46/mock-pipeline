Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the answers are only the direct responses to the questions. This could help the model learn to respond more directly.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying and extracting the key information from the output, such as the numerical answer in a math problem.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM to provide more direct responses. This would involve rewarding the model when it provides a direct response and penalizing it when it provides an indirect response.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing direct responses. For example, a sequence-to-sequence model might be more appropriate for this task.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a hybrid approach, combining the LLM with a rule-based system. The rule-based system could be used to process the LLM's output and extract the most relevant information.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a supervised learning approach, where we provide the LLM with examples of the correct output for a given input. This could help the model learn to produce more direct responses.
