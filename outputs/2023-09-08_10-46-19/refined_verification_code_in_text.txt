Here is the regenerated Python code with the requested modifications:

```python
import random
import re
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize OpenAI
openai = OpenAI()

# Define the Dataset
questions = []
for _ in range(1000):
    num1 = random.randint(1, 100)
    num2 = random.randint(1, 100)
    operation = random.choice(['+', '-', '*', '/'])
    question = f"What is {num1} {operation} {num2}?"
    questions.append(question)

# Split the Dataset
control_group = questions[:500]
experimental_group = [q.replace("What is", "Provide the numerical answer to") for q in questions[500:]]

# Run the Experiment
control_group_responses = []
for question in control_group:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=question, max_tokens=5)
    control_group_responses.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

experimental_group_responses = []
for question in experimental_group:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=question, max_tokens=5)
    experimental_group_responses.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

# Analyze the Results
Rc = sum([1 for response in control_group_responses if re.match("^\d+\.?\d*$", response)])
Re = sum([1 for response in experimental_group_responses if re.match("^\d+\.?\d*$", response)])

Pc = Rc / 500 * 100
Pe = Re / 500 * 100

# Compare the Results
if Pe > 80 and Pe > Pc:
    print("The hypothesis is supported.")
else:
    print("The hypothesis is not supported.")

# Report the Results
print(f"Control group: {Pc}% numerical responses")
print(f"Experimental group: {Pe}% numerical responses")
```
This code will generate a dataset of 1000 simple arithmetic questions, split them into a control group and an experimental group, run the experiment by inputting the questions into the LLM, analyze the results by counting the number of numerical responses, compare the results to test the hypothesis, and finally report the results.
