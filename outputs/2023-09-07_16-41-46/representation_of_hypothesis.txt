Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer will result in more concise responses. For instance, when the question "What is 1 + 1?" is modified to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?", the likelihood of receiving a one-word response will increase.

This hypothesis can be tested by conducting an experiment where a group of participants are asked to answer both versions of the question. The responses can then be analyzed to determine if the modified prompt resulted in more concise answers. 

In mathematical terms, let's denote the probability of receiving a one-word answer when the original prompt is used as P1, and the probability of receiving a one-word answer when the modified prompt is used as P2. The hypothesis can then be expressed as P2 > P1.
