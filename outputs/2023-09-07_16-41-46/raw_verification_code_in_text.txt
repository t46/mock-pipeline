# 1. Define the Experiment
# 1.1. Define the set of questions
questions = ["What is the capital of France?", "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?", "What is the chemical symbol for gold?", "Who discovered gravity?"]

# 1.2. Define the two groups of prompts
group_A = questions
group_B = [question + " Please answer in one word." for question in questions]

# 2. Data Collection
# 2.1. Input each prompt from Group A into the LLM and record the responses
responses_A = []
for prompt in group_A:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=10)
    responses_A.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

# 2.2. Repeat the process with Group B prompts
responses_B = []
for prompt in group_B:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=10)
    responses_B.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

# 3. Data Analysis
# 3.1. For each response, determine whether it is a one-word answer or not
one_word_A = [1 if len(response.split()) == 1 else 0 for response in responses_A]
one_word_B = [1 if len(response.split()) == 1 else 0 for response in responses_B]

# 3.2. Calculate the proportion of one-word answers for Group A prompts (P1) and Group B prompts (P2)
P1 = np.mean(one_word_A)
P2 = np.mean(one_word_B)

# 4. Hypothesis Testing
# 4.1. Formulate the null hypothesis (H0) as P1 = P2
# 4.2. Formulate the alternative hypothesis (H1) as P2 > P1
# 4.3. Use a statistical test to determine whether the difference in proportions is statistically significant
contingency_table = np.array([[sum(one_word_A), len(one_word_A) - sum(one_word_A)], [sum(one_word_B), len(one_word_B) - sum(one_word_B)]])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# 5. Result Interpretation
if p < 0.05:
    print("The null hypothesis is rejected. Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a one-word answer results in more concise responses.")
else:
    print("The null hypothesis is not rejected. Modifying the prompt does not significantly affect the conciseness of the responses.")

# 6. Report Writing
# This will be done outside of this code
