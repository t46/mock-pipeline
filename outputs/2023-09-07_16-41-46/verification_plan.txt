Verification Plan:

1. Define the Experiment:
   1.1. Define the set of questions to be used in the experiment. These should be diverse and cover a range of topics to ensure the results are not biased towards a specific type of question.
   1.2. Define the two groups of prompts: Group A will contain the original prompts, and Group B will contain the modified prompts that explicitly request a one-word answer.

2. Data Collection:
   2.1. Input each prompt from Group A into the LLM and record the responses.
   2.2. Repeat the process with Group B prompts.
   2.3. Ensure that the LLM is reset or cleared of any previous context before each prompt is input to avoid any influence on the responses.

3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. For each response, determine whether it is a one-word answer or not. This can be done by splitting the response into words and counting the number of words.
   3.2. Calculate the proportion of one-word answers for Group A prompts (P1) and Group B prompts (P2).

4. Hypothesis Testing:
   4.1. Formulate the null hypothesis (H0) as P1 = P2, which means there is no difference in the proportion of one-word answers between the two groups.
   4.2. Formulate the alternative hypothesis (H1) as P2 > P1, which is the hypothesis we want to test.
   4.3. Use a statistical test (such as a chi-square test for independence or a z-test for proportions) to determine whether the difference in proportions is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (usually 0.05), reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

5. Result Interpretation:
   5.1. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that modifying the prompt to explicitly request a one-word answer results in more concise responses.
   5.2. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it suggests that modifying the prompt does not significantly affect the conciseness of the responses.

6. Report Writing:
   6.1. Write a report detailing the experiment design, data collection and analysis methods, results, and conclusions.
   6.2. Discuss any limitations of the study and potential improvements for future research.

This plan will allow us to test the hypothesis in a systematic and rigorous manner, providing reliable and valid results.
