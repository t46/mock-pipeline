Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the desired output is a simple, direct answer. This could help the model learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing step that uses a smaller language model trained to extract the relevant information from the larger model's output. This smaller model could be trained on a dataset of the larger model's outputs and the corresponding desired outputs.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model, providing positive reinforcement when the model produces concise, direct answers and negative reinforcement when it produces extraneous text.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a rule-based system to extract the relevant information from the model's output. This system could be based on patterns observed in the model's outputs.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of the above methods, refining the training data, modifying the prompt, implementing a post-processing step, and using reinforcement learning and a rule-based system as needed. 

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to generating concise, direct answers. For example, a transformer model might be more appropriate than a recurrent neural network for this task. 

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task, such as question answering, and then fine-tune it on our specific task. This could help the model learn to generate more concise responses.
