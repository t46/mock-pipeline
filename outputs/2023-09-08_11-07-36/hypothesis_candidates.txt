1. Hypothesis: Refine the Prompting Strategy
   - We could refine the way we prompt the LLM. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Calculate 1 + 1 and provide the numerical answer only". This might encourage the model to provide a more direct response.

2. Hypothesis: Train a Post-Processing Model
   - We could train a separate machine learning model to post-process the LLM's output. This model would learn to extract the relevant information from the LLM's responses, regardless of the extraneous text.

3. Hypothesis: Fine-Tune the LLM
   - We could fine-tune the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers. This could encourage the model to generate responses that are more directly related to the prompts.

4. Hypothesis: Use a Reward Function
   - We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM, with a reward function that penalizes extraneous text. This could encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

5. Hypothesis: Modify the LLM's Architecture
   - We could modify the LLM's architecture to include an attention mechanism that focuses on the most relevant parts of the input when generating the output. This could help the model to generate responses that are more directly related to the prompts.

6. Hypothesis: Use a Multi-Step Process
   - We could use a multi-step process where the LLM first generates a response, then a second model or process refines that response to remove extraneous text. This could be a rule-based system, a machine learning model, or another LLM trained for this specific task.

7. Hypothesis: Use a Question-Answering Model
   - Instead of using a general-purpose LLM, we could use a model specifically designed for question-answering tasks. These models are often better at providing direct answers to questions.
