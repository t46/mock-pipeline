1. Hypothesis: Fine-tuning the LLM on a specific task could help it generate more precise responses. By training the model on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers, the model might learn to generate less extraneous text.

2. Hypothesis: Implementing a reward system during training could encourage the model to generate more concise responses. If the model is rewarded for shorter, more direct answers and penalized for longer, more verbose ones, it might learn to generate responses that are more directly related to the instructions.

3. Hypothesis: Using a different prompt structure could lead to more direct responses. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", the prompt could be "Calculate: 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to generate a more direct response.

4. Hypothesis: Implementing a post-processing method that extracts the most relevant information from the model's output could help. This method could use natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the part of the response that directly answers the question.

5. Hypothesis: Using a different model architecture could lead to more direct responses. For example, a model that is specifically designed for question answering tasks might be more likely to generate direct responses than a general-purpose language model.

6. Hypothesis: Implementing a system that allows the user to specify the desired format of the response could help. For example, the user could specify that they want the response in the form of a single number, which would encourage the model to generate a more direct response.

7. Hypothesis: Using a model that has been trained on a dataset of similar tasks could lead to more direct responses. For example, if the task is to answer math problems, a model that has been trained on a dataset of math problems might be more likely to generate direct responses.
