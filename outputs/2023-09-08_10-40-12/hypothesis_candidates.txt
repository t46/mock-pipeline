Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the model is expected to respond with a direct answer. This could help the model learn to provide more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could modify the prompt to instruct the model to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the most relevant information from the model's output. This could involve techniques like named entity recognition, coreference resolution, or information extraction.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model, providing rewards when the model gives a direct answer and penalties when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing direct answers. For example, a transformer model with a sequence-to-sequence architecture might be more appropriate.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a multi-stage approach, where the first stage generates a response and the second stage refines it to remove extraneous information.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model ensemble, where multiple models generate responses and a voting system is used to select the most direct answer.
