Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: We could modify the prompt to instruct the model to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Modifying the prompt to instruct the model to provide a direct answer will result in more concise responses. For instance, changing the question from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" will yield a single-word response.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a computer program that runs a series of tests on a model. The program will input both types of prompts (standard and modified) and record the length and complexity of the model's responses. The hypothesis can be represented mathematically as:

Let S be the set of standard prompts and M be the set of modified prompts. Let R_s and R_m be the responses to the standard and modified prompts respectively. The hypothesis can be represented as:

For all s in S and m in M, length(R_s) > length(R_m)

This means that for every prompt, the length of the response to the standard prompt is greater than the length of the response to the modified prompt. If this is true for a significant number of prompts, then the hypothesis is supported.
