Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Collect a diverse set of prompts that cover a wide range of topics and complexity. These prompts should be representative of the types of questions typically asked to the LLM. 
   1.2. For each prompt in the set, create a modified version that instructs the model to provide a direct answer. For example, if the original prompt is "What is 1 + 1?", the modified version would be "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. Divide the collected prompts into two sets: S (standard prompts) and M (modified prompts).
   2.2. Ensure that the LLM is set up and ready for testing. 

3. Execution:
   3.1. Input each prompt from set S into the LLM and record the responses in a list R_s.
   3.2. Repeat the process with set M, recording the responses in a separate list R_m.

4. Data Analysis:
   4.1. For each response in R_s and R_m, calculate the length of the response. This could be done by counting the number of words or characters in the response.
   4.2. Compare the lengths of the responses to the standard prompts (R_s) with the lengths of the responses to the modified prompts (R_m). 
   4.3. Calculate the average length of responses in R_s and R_m. 

5. Hypothesis Testing:
   5.1. If the average length of responses in R_s is significantly greater than the average length of responses in R_m, then the hypothesis is supported.
   5.2. If there is no significant difference in the average lengths, or if the average length of responses in R_m is greater, then the hypothesis is not supported.

6. Report Findings:
   6.1. Document the process and findings in a report. The report should include the methodology, data analysis, and conclusion about the hypothesis.
   6.2. If the hypothesis is supported, suggest implementing the strategy of modifying prompts for a more concise response from the LLM. If the hypothesis is not supported, suggest alternative strategies or further research.

7. Review and Refinement:
   7.1. Based on the findings, review the hypothesis and the testing process. 
   7.2. If necessary, refine the hypothesis or the testing process and repeat the verification plan.
