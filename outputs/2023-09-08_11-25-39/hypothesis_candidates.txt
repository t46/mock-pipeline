Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that contains only direct answers to the prompts during the training phase. 

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a feedback loop in the LLM where the model learns from its previous outputs. If the output is not directly related to the instructions, the model would receive negative feedback and adjust accordingly.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could use a secondary model to post-process the output of the LLM. This model would be trained to extract the most relevant part of the output, thus eliminating the need for predefined post-processing methods.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could modify the prompt structure to guide the LLM towards providing more direct answers. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical result of 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. The model would be rewarded when it provides direct answers and penalized when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to train the LLM. The supervised learning would ensure the model provides direct answers, while the unsupervised learning would allow the model to generalize and adapt to new prompts.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a rule-based system to post-process the output of the LLM. This system would have rules to identify and remove extraneous information from the output. 

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a neural network-based approach to post-process the output of the LLM. The neural network would be trained to identify and remove extraneous information from the output.
