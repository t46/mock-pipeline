Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: We could modify the prompt structure to guide the LLM towards providing more direct answers. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical result of 1 + 1".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: The structure of the prompt can influence the directness of the response from the Language Learning Model (LLM). Specifically, if the prompt is structured to request a specific type of answer, the LLM will provide a more direct response. For instance, if the prompt is "Provide the numerical result of 1 + 1", the LLM is more likely to respond directly with "2", compared to a more open-ended prompt like "What is 1 + 1?".

This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the responses of the LLM to different prompt structures. A set of mathematical problems can be used as prompts, with each problem presented in two different ways: a direct request for a numerical result and a more open-ended question. The directness of the LLM's responses can then be evaluated and compared.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let Pd be a direct prompt and Po be an open-ended prompt. Let Rd be the response to Pd and Ro be the response to Po. The hypothesis can be represented as:

If Pd, then Rd > Ro

This means that if a direct prompt is used, the directness of the response is greater than the directness of the response to an open-ended prompt.
