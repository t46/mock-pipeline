Here is the Python code to execute the verification plan:

```python
import openai
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Define the dataset
prompts = ["prompt1", "prompt2", "...", "prompt1000"]  # Replace with actual prompts
modified_prompts = ["Provide a one-word answer: " + prompt for prompt in prompts]

# Initialize lists to store responses
standard_responses = []
modified_responses = []

# Run the experiment
for prompt in prompts:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=100)
    standard_responses.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

for prompt in modified_prompts:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=100)
    modified_responses.append(response.choices[0].text.strip())

# Analyze the results
standard_lengths = [len(response.split()) for response in standard_responses]
modified_lengths = [len(response.split()) for response in modified_responses]

# Statistical analysis
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_rel(standard_lengths, modified_lengths)

# Evaluate the hypothesis
if p_val < 0.05:
    if np.mean(modified_lengths) < np.mean(standard_lengths):
        print("The hypothesis is supported.")
    else:
        print("The hypothesis is not supported.")
else:
    print("There is no significant difference in response lengths.")

# Report the results
# This part would involve writing up the results, which is beyond the scope of this code snippet.
```

Please replace `"prompt1", "prompt2", "...", "prompt1000"` with your actual prompts. Also, replace `"text-davinci-002"` with the actual engine you are using. The `max_tokens` parameter is set to 100, but you can adjust this according to your needs.
