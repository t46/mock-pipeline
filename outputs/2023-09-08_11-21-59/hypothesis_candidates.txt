Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the model is expected to respond with a direct answer. This could help the model learn to provide more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could modify the prompt to instruct the model to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing to extract the most relevant information from the model's output. This could involve identifying the key parts of the response and removing extraneous information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model to provide more concise responses. This could involve providing positive reinforcement when the model provides a direct answer and negative reinforcement when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is better suited to providing direct answers. For example, we could use a sequence-to-sequence model that is trained to map input sequences to output sequences.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a model ensemble, where multiple models are used to generate responses and the most concise response is selected.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task, such as question answering, and fine-tune it on our specific task. This could help the model learn to provide more direct answers.
