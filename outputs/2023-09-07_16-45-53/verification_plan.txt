Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Prepare a dataset of mathematical problems that can be solved by the LLM. The dataset should be large enough to ensure statistical significance, for example, 1000 problems.
   1.2. For each problem, prepare two versions of the prompt: the original version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and the modified version (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1").
   1.3. Also, prepare the correct answer for each problem for later comparison.

2. Experiment Setup:
   2.1. Divide the dataset into two equal parts, each containing 500 problems. Let's call them Set A and Set B.
   2.2. Set A will be used with the original prompts and Set B with the modified prompts.

3. Experiment Execution:
   3.1. Input each problem from Set A into the LLM using the original prompt and record the output.
   3.2. Repeat the process for Set B, but use the modified prompts.
   3.3. For each output, check if it matches the correct answer exactly. If it does, mark it as a correct response. If not, mark it as an incorrect response.

4. Data Analysis:
   4.1. Calculate the percentage of correct responses for Set A. This will be represented as A.
   4.2. Calculate the percentage of correct responses for Set B. This will be represented as B.
   4.3. Compare A and B. If B > A, it indicates that the modified prompts resulted in a higher percentage of correct responses, supporting the hypothesis. If B <= A, it indicates that the modified prompts did not improve the accuracy, not supporting the hypothesis.

5. Reporting:
   5.1. Document the entire process, including the preparation of the dataset, the experiment setup, the execution process, and the data analysis.
   5.2. Report the results in a clear and concise manner, stating whether the hypothesis was supported or not.
   5.3. Discuss potential reasons for the results and suggest future directions for further investigation.

This plan will allow us to test the hypothesis in a systematic and rigorous manner, providing clear evidence to support or refute it.
