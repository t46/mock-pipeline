Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that contains only direct answers to the questions, thus teaching the model to respond in a similar manner.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another LLM to extract the relevant information from the output. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the most relevant part of the response.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompts to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By rewarding the model when it provides direct answers and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information, the model might learn to provide more direct responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a rule-based system to extract the relevant information from the output. This system could be based on patterns in the language, such as the fact that the answer to a mathematical question is often a number.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of several methods. For example, we could refine the training process, modify the prompts, and use a post-processing method to extract the relevant information. This could increase the chances of getting a direct answer.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a supervised learning approach where the model is trained on a dataset of questions and direct answers. The model could then learn to generate responses that are similar to the direct answers in the training data.
