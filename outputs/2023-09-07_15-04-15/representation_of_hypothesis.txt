Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate a more concise response.

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the prompt to instruct the Language Learning Model (LLM) to provide a direct answer will result in a more concise response. For instance, instead of using the prompt "What is 1 + 1?", we could use "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". 

To test this hypothesis, we can use a set of mathematical questions and compare the conciseness of the responses generated by the LLM when given the original prompt versus the modified prompt. We can measure conciseness by the number of words in the response. 

Mathematically, we can represent this as:

Let A be the average number of words in the responses to the original prompt and B be the average number of words in the responses to the modified prompt. 

Our hypothesis can then be represented as: B < A. 

If B is indeed less than A, this would support our hypothesis that modifying the prompt results in more concise responses from the LLM.
