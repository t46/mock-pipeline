Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that only contains direct answers to the prompts. This way, the model might learn to generate responses that are more concise and directly related to the instructions.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another LLM to extract the relevant information from the output. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the most relevant part of the response, which in this case would be the direct answer to the question.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt to instruct the LLM to provide a direct answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate a more concise response.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By providing rewards for concise and direct answers and penalties for extraneous information, the model might learn to generate more relevant responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that identifies and removes common extraneous phrases from the output. For example, the system could be programmed to remove phrases like "The answer to that question is" from the output.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a combination of the above methods. For example, we could refine the training process and also implement a post-processing method. This might increase the chances of getting a direct answer from the LLM.
