Here is a Python code to execute the verification plan:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Collect a set of mathematical questions
questions = ["What is 1 + 1?", "What is 2 * 2?", ...]  # Continue until 1000 questions

# Prepare two versions of each question
questions_original = questions
questions_modified = ["Provide a one-word answer: " + q for q in questions]

# Divide the set of questions into two equal subsets
subset_A = questions_original[:500]
subset_B = questions_modified[500:]

# Input the questions into the LLM and record the responses
responses_A = [openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=q) for q in subset_A]
responses_B = [openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=q) for q in subset_B]

# Count the number of words in each response, excluding stop words
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
word_counts_A = vectorizer.fit_transform(responses_A).toarray().sum(axis=1)
word_counts_B = vectorizer.fit_transform(responses_B).toarray().sum(axis=1)

# Calculate the average number of words in the responses
avg_words_A = np.mean(word_counts_A)
avg_words_B = np.mean(word_counts_B)

# Perform a t-test to determine if the difference in the average number of words is statistically significant
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(word_counts_A, word_counts_B)

# Report the results
print(f"Average number of words in responses for Subset A (original version): {avg_words_A}")
print(f"Average number of words in responses for Subset B (modified version): {avg_words_B}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat}, p-value: {p_value}")

# Provide recommendations or propose new hypotheses based on the results
if p_value < 0.05 and avg_words_B < avg_words_A:
    print("The hypothesis is supported. Modifying the prompt results in more concise responses from the LLM.")
else:
    print("The hypothesis is not supported. Potential reasons could be the complexity of the questions or the LLM's interpretation of the modified prompts.")
```

Please replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key. Also, replace `"What is 1 + 1?", "What is 2 * 2?", ...` with your actual list of 1000 mathematical questions.
