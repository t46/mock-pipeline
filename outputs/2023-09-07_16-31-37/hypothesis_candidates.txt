Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training data to include more examples where the desired output is a direct answer. This could help the model learn to provide more concise responses.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing step that uses another language model trained to extract the most relevant information from the output. This model could be trained on a dataset of LLM outputs and their corresponding concise answers.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the model, providing positive feedback when the model gives concise, direct answers and negative feedback when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a two-step approach where the first model generates the response and the second model simplifies or summarizes the response.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing system that identifies and removes common extraneous phrases, such as "The answer to that question is".

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a hybrid approach that combines several of the above methods, such as refining the training data, modifying the prompt, and implementing a post-processing step.
