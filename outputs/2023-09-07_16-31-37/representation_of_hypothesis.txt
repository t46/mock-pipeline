Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: We could modify the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?".

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Modifying the prompt to explicitly request a concise answer will result in more concise responses. For instance, changing the question from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?" will yield a one-word response more frequently.

To test this hypothesis, we could conduct an experiment where we ask a group of participants a series of questions. Half of the questions would be phrased in the traditional manner (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?"), while the other half would be phrased to explicitly request a concise answer (e.g., "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?"). We would then compare the length of the responses to the two types of questions to determine if the modified prompts resulted in more concise answers.

In mathematical terms, let's denote the average length of responses to traditional questions as T and the average length of responses to modified questions as M. Our hypothesis would then be that M < T.
