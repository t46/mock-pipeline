Here is the regenerated Python code with the requested modifications:

```python
import random
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt-2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt-2')

# Prepare the list of questions
questions = [
    ("What is 1 + 1?", "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?"),
    # Add more questions here...
]

# Randomly divide the questions into two sets
random.shuffle(questions)
half = len(questions) // 2
set1 = questions[:half]
set2 = questions[half:]

# Function to get model response
def get_response(question):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(question, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
    return response

# Function to calculate response length
def calculate_length(response):
    return len(response.split())

# Collect responses and calculate lengths
lengths_set1 = [calculate_length(get_response(q[0])) for q in set1]
lengths_set2 = [calculate_length(get_response(q[1])) for q in set2]

# Calculate averages
average_set1 = np.mean(lengths_set1)
average_set2 = np.mean(lengths_set2)

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(lengths_set1, lengths_set2)

# Print results
print(f"Average length of responses to traditional questions: {average_set1}")
print(f"Average length of responses to modified questions: {average_set2}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat}, p-value: {p_val}")

# Interpret results
if p_val < 0.05:
    print("The difference in response lengths is statistically significant.")
else:
    print("The difference in response lengths is not statistically significant.")
```

Please note that the GPT-4 model does not exist, so I replaced it with GPT-2. If you have a custom model named 'gpt-4', you can replace 'gpt-2' with 'gpt-4'.
