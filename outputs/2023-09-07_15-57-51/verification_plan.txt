Verification Plan:

1. Data Collection:
   1.1. Prepare a dataset of questions that can be answered in one word. This dataset should be diverse and cover different types of questions to ensure the robustness of the test. For example, it can include mathematical questions, factual questions, yes/no questions, etc.
   1.2. For each question in the dataset, create two versions of prompts: a standard prompt (P1) and a one-word answer prompt (P2). For example, if the question is "What is the capital of France?", P1 would be "What is the capital of France?" and P2 would be "Provide a one-word answer: What is the capital of France?".

2. Experiment Execution:
   2.1. Input each P1 into the LLM and record the response as R1.
   2.2. Input the corresponding P2 into the LLM and record the response as R2.
   2.3. Repeat steps 2.1 and 2.2 for all questions in the dataset.

3. Data Analysis:
   3.1. For each pair of responses (R1, R2), calculate the length of the response in words.
   3.2. Compare the length of R1 and R2. If the length of R2 is less than or equal to the length of R1, mark it as a success; otherwise, mark it as a failure.
   3.3. Calculate the success rate as the number of successes divided by the total number of questions in the dataset.

4. Hypothesis Testing:
   4.1. If the success rate is significantly higher than 50%, the hypothesis is supported.
   4.2. If the success rate is not significantly higher than 50%, the hypothesis is not supported.

5. Reporting:
   5.1. Prepare a report summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusion of the test.
   5.2. Include in the report any observations about the types of questions for which the one-word answer prompt was particularly effective or ineffective.
   5.3. Discuss potential improvements to the prompting strategy based on the results of the test.

6. Review and Refinement:
   6.1. Based on the results and observations, refine the prompting strategy if necessary.
   6.2. Repeat the test with the refined prompting strategy to verify its effectiveness.
