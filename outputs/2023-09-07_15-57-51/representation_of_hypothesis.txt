Original Hypothesis:
We could refine the way we prompt the LLM. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

Refined Hypothesis:
The refinement of the prompting strategy, specifically by requesting a one-word answer, will result in more concise responses from the Language Learning Model (LLM). 

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative analysis between the responses generated by the LLM when prompted with a standard question and when prompted with a one-word answer request. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Let's denote the standard prompt as P1 and the one-word answer prompt as P2. The responses generated by the LLM for these prompts are denoted as R1 and R2 respectively. 

The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the length (in words) of R1 and R2. If the length of R2 is less than or equal to the length of R1, the hypothesis is supported. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

If Length(R2) â‰¤ Length(R1), then the hypothesis is supported.

This hypothesis testing can be implemented using a computer program that prompts the LLM with P1 and P2, captures the responses R1 and R2, calculates their lengths, and compares them.
