1. Hypothesis: Refining the Prompting Strategy
   - We could refine the way we prompt the LLM. For instance, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide a one-word answer: What is 1 + 1?". This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

2. Hypothesis: Training a Post-Processing Model
   - We could train a separate model to post-process the LLM's output. This model would learn to extract the relevant information from the LLM's responses, regardless of the extraneous text.

3. Hypothesis: Fine-Tuning the LLM
   - We could fine-tune the LLM on a dataset where the correct responses are only the direct answers to the questions. This might encourage the model to generate more concise responses.

4. Hypothesis: Implementing a Reward System
   - We could implement a reward system that encourages the LLM to generate responses that are directly related to the instructions. This could be done using reinforcement learning techniques.

5. Hypothesis: Using a Question-Answering Model
   - Instead of using a general-purpose LLM, we could use a model specifically designed for question-answering tasks. These models are typically trained to provide concise, direct answers to questions.

6. Hypothesis: Implementing a Response Length Limit
   - We could implement a response length limit, forcing the LLM to generate shorter responses. This might encourage the model to only include the most relevant information in its responses.

7. Hypothesis: Using a Multi-Step Process
   - We could use a multi-step process where the LLM first generates a response, then a second model or process refines or shortens that response to only include the most relevant information.
