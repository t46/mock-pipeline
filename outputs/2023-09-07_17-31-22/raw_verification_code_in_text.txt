```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Step 1: Define the Experiment
# Define what constitutes a "direct" and "indirect" response
def is_direct_response(response, answer):
    return response.strip().lower() == answer.strip().lower()

# Define a set of questions and answers
questions = ["What is 1 + 1?", "What is the capital of France?", "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?", "What is the chemical symbol for gold?"]
answers = ["2", "Paris", "Harper Lee", "Au"]

# Step 2: Prepare the Data
# Create two versions of each question: a general version and a specific prompt version
general_questions = questions
specific_questions = ["Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1", "Name the capital city of France", "Name the author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'", "Provide the chemical symbol for gold"]

# Step 3: Conduct the Experiment
# Input each question into the LLM and record the responses
# For simplicity, we will simulate this step with a placeholder function
def ask_llm(question):
    return "Placeholder response"

general_responses = [ask_llm(q) for q in general_questions]
specific_responses = [ask_llm(q) for q in specific_questions]

# Determine whether each response is direct or indirect
general_directness = [is_direct_response(r, a) for r, a in zip(general_responses, answers)]
specific_directness = [is_direct_response(r, a) for r, a in zip(specific_responses, answers)]

# Step 4: Analyze the Results
# Calculate the proportion of direct responses for each format
general_direct_proportion = np.mean(general_directness)
specific_direct_proportion = np.mean(specific_directness)

# Step 5: Statistical Testing
# Perform a chi-square test for independence
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(index=[general_directness, specific_directness], columns=["counts"])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Step 6: Draw Conclusions
if p < 0.05:
    print("The specific prompt format is more likely to result in a direct response.")
else:
    print("The specific prompt format does not significantly affect the directness of responses.")

# Step 7: Document the Results
# This step would involve writing a detailed report, which is beyond the scope of this code

# Step 8: Peer Review
# This step would involve having the experiment and its results reviewed by peers or experts, which is beyond the scope of this code
