Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that only contains direct answers to the prompts. The model would then learn to generate responses that are more concise and directly related to the prompts.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another AI model to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This model could be trained to identify and extract the key information from a sentence, regardless of the extraneous text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompt structure to guide the LLM towards providing more direct answers. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1".

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By rewarding the model when it provides direct answers and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information, the model could learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning part would involve training the model on a dataset of prompts and direct answers, while the unsupervised part would involve letting the model learn from its own generated responses.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could implement a feedback loop where the LLM's output is fed back into the model as a new prompt. This could encourage the model to focus on the most relevant information in its responses.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a multi-stage approach where the LLM first generates a response, then a second model refines this response to remove any extraneous information. This second model could be trained specifically for this task, using a dataset of LLM outputs and their refined versions.
