Verification Plan:

1. Define the Experiment:
   1.1. Define what constitutes a "direct" and "indirect" response. For instance, a direct response could be defined as one that only contains the answer to the question, while an indirect response could be defined as one that contains additional, unnecessary information.
   1.2. Define a set of questions that will be used in the experiment. These questions should cover a variety of topics and complexities to ensure the results are generalizable.

2. Prepare the Data:
   2.1. For each question in the set, create two versions: a general question version (e.g., "What is 1 + 1?") and a specific prompt version (e.g., "Provide the numerical answer for 1 + 1").
   2.2. Create a dataset that includes both versions of each question.

3. Conduct the Experiment:
   3.1. Input each question from the dataset into the LLM and record the responses.
   3.2. For each response, determine whether it is direct or indirect based on the definitions established in step 1.1.

4. Analyze the Results:
   4.1. Calculate the proportion of direct responses for the general question format and the specific prompt format.
   4.2. Compare these proportions to determine whether the specific prompt format resulted in a higher proportion of direct responses.

5. Statistical Testing:
   5.1. Perform a statistical test (e.g., a chi-square test for independence) to determine whether the difference in proportions is statistically significant.
   5.2. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative hypothesis (H1). This would indicate that the specific prompt format is more likely to result in a direct response.

6. Draw Conclusions:
   6.1. If the results support the hypothesis, consider implementing the specific prompt format in the LLM to improve the directness of responses.
   6.2. If the results do not support the hypothesis, consider other strategies for improving the directness of responses, such as refining the LLM's training data or adjusting its parameters.

7. Document the Results:
   7.1. Write a report detailing the experiment, the results, and the conclusions. This report should include all relevant data and calculations, as well as any limitations of the experiment and suggestions for future research. 

8. Peer Review:
   8.1. Have the experiment and its results reviewed by peers or experts in the field to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. 

This verification plan provides a systematic and rigorous approach to testing the hypothesis that the structure of the prompt can influence the directness of the response from the LLM. By following this plan, we can determine whether this strategy is effective and, if so, implement it to improve the LLM's performance.
