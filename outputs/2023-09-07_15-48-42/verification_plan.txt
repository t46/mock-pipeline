Verification Plan:

1. Define the Dataset:
   1.1. Select a diverse set of questions that can be asked in both a general and specific manner. The questions should cover a wide range of topics to ensure the results are not biased towards a specific type of question.
   1.2. For each question, create two versions: a general version and a specific version. For example, the general version of a math question might be "What is 1 + 1?", while the specific version might be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".

2. Generate Responses:
   2.1. Input the general version of each question into the LLM and record the output.
   2.2. Repeat the process with the specific version of each question.

3. Evaluate Directness:
   3.1. Develop a scoring system to measure the directness of a response. This could be a binary system where a score of 1 is given if the response is direct and a score of 0 is given if the response is indirect. Alternatively, it could be a more nuanced system where responses are given a score between 0 and 1 based on their level of directness.
   3.2. Score each response generated by the LLM using the scoring system. This will result in a directness score for each response.

4. Analyze the Results:
   4.1. Calculate the average directness score for the responses to the general prompts (Dg).
   4.2. Calculate the average directness score for the responses to the specific prompts (Ds).
   4.3. Compare Ds and Dg. If Ds > Dg, the hypothesis is supported; otherwise, it is not.

5. Statistical Testing:
   5.1. Perform a statistical test (such as a t-test) to determine whether the difference between Ds and Dg is statistically significant. This will provide further evidence to support or refute the hypothesis.

6. Document the Results:
   6.1. Record the results of the experiment, including the average directness scores for the general and specific prompts and the results of the statistical test.
   6.2. Write a report summarizing the findings of the experiment. The report should include a discussion of whether the results support the hypothesis and any potential implications for the use of LLMs.

7. Review and Refine:
   7.1. Based on the results, review and refine the hypothesis if necessary. If the hypothesis is not supported, consider alternative hypotheses that could explain the observed behavior of the LLM.
   7.2. Repeat the experiment with the refined hypothesis and new set of prompts if necessary.
