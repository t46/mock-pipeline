Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the training process of the LLM to focus more on the direct answers. This could be achieved by using a dataset that contains only direct answers to the prompts during the training phase. This way, the model might learn to generate responses that are more concise and directly related to the prompts.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses another LLM to extract the relevant information from the output. This secondary model could be trained to identify and extract the most relevant part of the response, effectively filtering out the extraneous text.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could modify the prompts to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to generate more direct responses.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. By providing rewards for direct answers and penalties for extraneous text, the model might learn to generate more concise responses.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a combination of supervised learning and unsupervised learning to train the LLM. The supervised learning phase could focus on generating direct responses, while the unsupervised learning phase could focus on understanding the context of the prompts.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could implement a feedback loop where the output of the LLM is evaluated and the results are used to adjust the model's parameters. This could help the model learn to generate more direct responses over time.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that identifies and removes common phrases or sentences that are often included in the output but are not directly related to the prompts. This could be a more general solution than a predefined post-processing method.
