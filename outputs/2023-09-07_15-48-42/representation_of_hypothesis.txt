Original Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: We could modify the prompts to be more specific about the type of response we want. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the model to generate more direct responses.

Refined Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Modifying the prompts to be more specific about the type of response required will increase the likelihood of the model generating direct responses. For instance, changing the prompt from "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1" will result in a more direct response from the model.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a comparative analysis method. We will use a set of questions with two different types of prompts: general prompts and specific prompts. The general prompts will be like "What is 1 + 1?", while the specific prompts will be like "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". 

We will then compare the directness of the responses generated by the model for each type of prompt. The directness of a response can be measured by how quickly and accurately it answers the question without providing unnecessary information. 

Mathematically, we can represent the directness of a response as a score from 0 to 1, where 0 represents a completely indirect response and 1 represents a completely direct response. 

The hypothesis can then be tested by comparing the average directness scores for the responses to the general prompts (Dg) and the specific prompts (Ds). If Ds > Dg, the hypothesis is supported; otherwise, it is not. 

In mathematical terms, the hypothesis can be expressed as:

H0 (null hypothesis): Ds = Dg
H1 (alternative hypothesis): Ds > Dg

Where:
Ds = Average directness score for responses to specific prompts
Dg = Average directness score for responses to general prompts
