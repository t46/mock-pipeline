Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM on a dataset where the answers are only the direct responses to the questions. This could help the model learn to respond more directly.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could implement a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying and extracting the numerical or factual answer from the output.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM to provide more direct answers. This would involve rewarding the model when it provides a direct answer and penalizing it when it provides extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to providing direct answers. For example, a transformer-based model might be more effective at this task.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a hybrid approach, combining the LLM with a more structured model that is designed to provide direct answers. The LLM could be used to understand the question, and the structured model could be used to provide the answer.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a rule-based post-processing method that removes common extraneous phrases from the LLM's output. This would require a list of such phrases, which could be generated through analysis of the LLM's outputs.

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a supervised learning approach to train a separate model to predict whether the LLM's output is a direct answer or not. This model could then be used to filter the LLM's outputs.
