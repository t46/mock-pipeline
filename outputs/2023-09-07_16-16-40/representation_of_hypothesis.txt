Original Hypothesis:
The hypothesis suggests that refining prompts to be more specific, such as changing "What is 1 + 1?" to "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1", might encourage the Language Learning Model (LLM) to respond with just the number.

Refined Hypothesis:
The hypothesis can be refined and made more specific by stating it as follows: "The specificity of a prompt directly influences the LLM's response. If a prompt is more specific, such as asking for a 'numerical answer' instead of a general 'what is', the LLM is more likely to respond with a precise numerical answer."

This hypothesis can be tested by conducting an experiment where the LLM is given two sets of prompts - one set with general questions and another with specific questions. The responses can then be analyzed to see if there is a significant difference in the precision of the answers.

Mathematical Representation:
Let's denote the set of general prompts as G and the set of specific prompts as S. The responses from the LLM to these prompts are denoted as R_G and R_S respectively. The hypothesis can then be represented as:

If G -> R_G and S -> R_S, then the precision of R_S > precision of R_G.

This means that if we give general prompts (G) and specific prompts (S) to the LLM, the precision of the responses to the specific prompts (R_S) will be greater than the precision of the responses to the general prompts (R_G).
