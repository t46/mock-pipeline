Experiment Report:

General Prompts: {general_prompts}
Specific Prompts: {specific_prompts}
Precise Responses: {precise_responses}

Responses to General Prompts: {responses_G}
Responses to Specific Prompts: {responses_S}

Precision of Responses to General Prompts: {precision_G}
Precision of Responses to Specific Prompts: {precision_S}

Conclusion: {conclusion}

Limitations: This experiment was conducted with a limited number of prompts and responses. The results may not be generalizable to all types of prompts and responses.

Suggestions for Future Research: Conduct the experiment with a larger and more diverse set of prompts and responses. Use statistical tests to compare the precision of the responses to the general and specific prompts.
