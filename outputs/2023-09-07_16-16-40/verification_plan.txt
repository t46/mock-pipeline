Verification Plan:

1. Define the Experiment:
   1.1. Define what constitutes a general prompt (G) and a specific prompt (S). For example, a general prompt might be "What is 1 + 1?" and a specific prompt might be "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1".
   1.2. Define what constitutes a precise response. For example, a precise response to the above prompts would be "2".

2. Create Datasets:
   2.1. Create a dataset of general prompts (G). This dataset should contain a variety of questions, not just mathematical ones, to ensure the results are generalizable.
   2.2. Create a corresponding dataset of specific prompts (S). Each specific prompt should correspond to a general prompt in the G dataset, but be more specific in its request for a response.

3. Conduct the Experiment:
   3.1. Input the general prompts (G) into the LLM and record the responses (R_G).
   3.2. Input the specific prompts (S) into the LLM and record the responses (R_S).

4. Analyze the Results:
   4.1. For each response in R_G and R_S, determine whether it is a precise response as defined in step 1.2.
   4.2. Calculate the proportion of precise responses in R_G and R_S. This will give a measure of the precision of the responses to the general and specific prompts.

5. Compare the Results:
   5.1. Compare the precision of the responses to the general prompts (R_G) with the precision of the responses to the specific prompts (R_S).
   5.2. If the precision of R_S is significantly greater than the precision of R_G, this would support the hypothesis. If there is no significant difference, or if the precision of R_G is greater, this would not support the hypothesis.

6. Document the Findings:
   6.1. Write a report detailing the experiment, the results, and the conclusions. This report should include all the data collected, the calculations made, and any statistical tests used to compare the results.
   6.2. The report should also discuss any limitations of the experiment and suggest potential improvements for future research.

7. Peer Review:
   7.1. Submit the report for peer review. This will ensure that the experiment was conducted correctly, the results are valid, and the conclusions are justified by the data.

8. Repeat the Experiment:
   8.1. If the results are inconclusive or the hypothesis is not supported, refine the hypothesis and repeat the experiment. This iterative process is a fundamental part of the scientific method and helps to ensure that the results are reliable and valid.
