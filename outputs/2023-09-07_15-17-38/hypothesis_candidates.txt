Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM with a dataset that includes both the question and the desired format of the answer. This could help the model learn to respond in the desired format.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could develop a post-processing algorithm that extracts the most relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the key information.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it provides the answer in the desired format and penalize it when it includes extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a different model architecture that is more suited to this task. For example, a sequence-to-sequence model might be better at producing concise answers.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a two-step process where the LLM first generates a response, and then a second model refines that response to remove any extraneous information.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a model that has been pre-trained on a similar task. This could help the model understand the desired format of the answer.

Hypothesis 8: 
We could use a combination of the above approaches. For example, we could refine the prompts, use reinforcement learning, and develop a post-processing algorithm.
