Hypothesis 1: 
We could refine the prompts to be more specific. For example, instead of asking "What is 1 + 1?", we could ask "Provide the numerical answer to 1 + 1". This might encourage the LLM to respond with just the number.

Hypothesis 2: 
We could train the LLM with a dataset that includes both the question and the desired format of the answer. This could help the model learn to respond in the desired format.

Hypothesis 3: 
We could develop a post-processing method that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract the relevant information from the LLM's output. This could involve identifying and extracting the numerical answer from the text.

Hypothesis 4: 
We could use reinforcement learning to train the LLM. We could reward the model when it provides the answer in the desired format and penalize it when it includes extraneous information.

Hypothesis 5: 
We could use a two-step process where the first step is the LLM generating the answer and the second step is a separate model that takes the LLM's output and simplifies it to the desired format.

Hypothesis 6: 
We could use a rule-based approach to post-processing, where we define a set of rules that the output must follow. For example, if the question is a math problem, the answer must be a number.

Hypothesis 7: 
We could use a hybrid approach that combines several of the above methods. For example, we could refine the prompts, train the LLM with a specific dataset, and use NLP for post-processing.
