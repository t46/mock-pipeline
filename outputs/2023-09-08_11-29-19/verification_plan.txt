Verification Plan:

1. **Data Collection:**
    1.1. Identify a set of general prompts that are typically used with the LLM. These should be prompts that have previously resulted in extraneous text in the LLM's responses.
    1.2. For each general prompt, create a corresponding specific prompt. The specific prompt should be designed to elicit the same information as the general prompt, but with more specificity to encourage a more direct response.
    1.3. Ensure that the sets of general and specific prompts are of equal size to avoid bias in the experiment.

2. **Experiment Execution:**
    2.1. Input each general prompt into the LLM and record the response.
    2.2. Input each specific prompt into the LLM and record the response.
    2.3. Ensure that the LLM is in the same state (i.e., not updated or modified) during the entire experiment to maintain consistency.

3. **Data Analysis:**
    3.1. Categorize each response from the LLM as either a numerical response or a non-numerical response. A numerical response is one that contains only the numerical answer to the prompt, while a non-numerical response contains additional text.
    3.2. Count the number of numerical responses for the general prompts (N_G) and the specific prompts (N_S).

4. **Statistical Testing:**
    4.1. Perform a chi-square test for independence to compare the proportions of numerical responses for the general and specific prompts.
    4.2. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the proportion of numerical responses is the same for general and specific prompts (P(N_G) = P(N_S)).
    4.3. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the proportion of numerical responses is less for general prompts than for specific prompts (P(N_G) < P(N_S)).
    4.4. If the p-value from the chi-square test is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the specificity of prompts influences the type of response from the LLM.

5. **Result Interpretation:**
    5.1. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that more specific prompts result in more numerical responses from the LLM.
    5.2. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, this suggests that the specificity of prompts does not significantly influence the type of response from the LLM.
    5.3. In either case, the results of this experiment should be interpreted with caution, as other factors not controlled for in this experiment could also influence the LLM's responses.
